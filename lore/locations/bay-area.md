# San Francisco Bay Area

The primary setting for Quantum Error, both pre- and post-Transition. After the Transition, the Bay Area transformed from a modern tech hub into a dangerous fantasy landscape. Technology failed, mana flooded the world, and monsters emerged.

## Pre-Transition Locations

| Location | City | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| [IQuantum](../organizations/iquantum.md) | Saratoga | Quantum computer company; where the simulation runs |
| [Clint's](../../characters/party/clint.md) House | Sunnyvale | Protagonist's residence |
| Friend's House | Mountain View | Safehouse during pre-Transition events |
| [Vanessa's](../../characters/party/vanessa.md) House | San Francisco | — |

## Post-Transition: The Peninsula Corridor

After the Transition, the livable area of the Peninsula contracted to a narrow corridor along the eastern side of the mountains. The party progresses south from San Francisco through increasingly dangerous zones, leveling from 1 to 25 over the course of Book 1.

                    [THE MIRE]  (Mountain View / Sunnyvale, L21-25)

                    [SAN JOSE]  (Goblin Encampment, L25)
```

### Boundaries

The corridor is hemmed in on all sides, creating a natural progression path:

**Western Wall — Dragon Territory (L90-99):** The Santa Cruz Mountains and Skyline Blvd form a natural barrier, extended by the system into an impassable wall. Dragons are visible flying beyond it. They don't cross — system logic prevents it. This is endgame territory for future books. The wall is a system-generated extension of the mountain range, not a constructed fortification.

**Eastern Edge — San Francisco Bay:** The bay itself is the eastern boundary. The Bay Bridge connecting to Oakland and the East Bay is blocked by a L30 Troll who keeps lower-level travelers from crossing into higher-level zones.

**Northern Gate — Golden Gate Bridge:** A L50 Troll blocks northbound access across the Golden Gate. The North Bay (Marin, Sonoma, Napa) is future content — high-level zones for later books.

**Southern Terminus — San Jose:** The Goblin Encampment under [Eron Vosk](../../characters/villains/eron-vosk.md) is the Book 1 capstone at L25. Beyond San Jose, Saratoga houses the dragon endgame entrance — effectively sealed until Book 5.

### Zone Index

| Zone | Level | Cities | Theme | File |
|------|-------|--------|-------|------|
| [San Francisco](zones/san-francisco.md) | 1-5 | San Francisco | Urban safe zone, starter quests | Safe zone |
| [The Ruins](zones/the-ruins.md) | 5-9 | South SF, Daly City, Colma | Suburban decay, scavengers, undead | First outdoor zone |
| [The Foglands](zones/the-foglands.md) | 9-13 | San Bruno, Millbrae | Magical fog, hill terrain, ambush predators | Fog and elevation |
| [The Creeklands](zones/the-creeklands.md) | 13-17 | San Mateo, Belmont | Flooding watersheds, overgrown foothills | Water and plants |
| [The Deepwood](zones/the-deepwood.md) | 17-21 | Redwood City, Palo Alto | Supernatural forest, dense canopy | Forest and goblins |
| [The Mire](zones/the-mire.md) | 21-25 | Mountain View, Sunnyvale | Expanding marshlands, goblin military | Swamp and war |
| [San Jose](zones/san-jose.md) | 25 | San Jose | Goblin Encampment — Book 1 capstone | Endgame zone |

### Aggro & Detection

The overworld uses level-based [aggro detection](../../system/aggro.md). Higher-level mobs detect players from farther away, making it progressively harder to travel through zones above your level. The party's boosted 999 HP lets them survive individual fights with higher-level mobs, but aggro range means they can't avoid being swarmed.

### Goblin Escalation

[Goblins](../../races/goblin.md) appear gradually as the party moves south, foreshadowing the San Jose endgame:
- **L14-15 (Creeklands):** Goblin Scouts — small scouting parties, first encounter
- **L18-20 (Deepwood):** Forest Goblins — adapted ambushers, more common
- **L22-24 (Mire):** Goblin Warriors + Shamans — organized military patrols
- **L25 (San Jose):** Full goblin army under [Eron Vosk](../../characters/villains/eron-vosk.md)

### Bridge Trolls

Two [Trolls](../../races/troll.md) serve as gating mechanics, preventing low-level players from accessing high-level regions:

**Bay Bridge Troll (L30):** Blocks access to the East Bay. Not a boss fight in Book 1 — a warning. Higher-level zones exist beyond, for future books.

**Golden Gate Troll (L50):** Blocks northbound access to the North Bay. Even more imposing. The party won't challenge this for a long time.

### Future Zones (Brief)

- **East Bay** (beyond Bay Bridge): L30+ zones. Oakland, Berkeley, and beyond. Future books.
- **North Bay** (beyond Golden Gate): L50+ zones. Marin, Sonoma. Future books.
- **Dragon Territory** (west of Skyline): L90-99. The Santa Cruz Mountains and coastal regions. Ancient Red Dragon at the former [IQuantum](../organizations/iquantum.md) site in Saratoga. Endgame content.
- **Golden Gate Park:** L35, faction-based. Elves and dryads. Accessible from SF but dangerous.
