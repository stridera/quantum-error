# San Francisco (Safe Zone, L1-5)

The primary safe zone for humanity after the Transition. The city's dense urban core remains relatively stable — buildings still stand, the streets are navigable, and the system recognizes it as a protected area. No hostile mobs spawn in the open. Combat content exists only inside instanced locations (basements, sewers, abandoned buildings).

## Description

San Francisco post-Transition is a city that should be collapsing — but isn't. Like all major cities, SF became a [safe zone](../../overview.md#safe-zones) where the system protects against hostile spawns. And like all safe zones, [profession translation](../../overview.md#profession-translation) kicked in — the Bay Area's massive concentration of tech workers means SF has one of the highest densities of enchanters and engineers anywhere. The cable cars run on mana now. Builder-mages have reinforced the Victorian row houses and the downtown high-rises. The city is battered, but it's holding and improving daily.

[Celeste](../../../characters/supporting/celeste.md) runs Clayandsteel out of the city — forging weapons with her craft magic while her enchanter husband inscribes them. They're one example of the partnerships forming as people figure out how their old skills work in the new world.

The fog still rolls in from the Pacific, but it feels different now. Warmer. Alive.

The Golden Gate and Bay Bridges glow faintly with protective wards — beautiful and imposing. The wards don't keep people in, but the Trolls do.

## Level Range

**L1-5.** Starter content for normal people who spawned into the system with no abilities and no understanding. These quests exist to get the average person to level 5-10 before they venture outside the city.

The party mostly skips this content. They respawn in SF at L1-5 — [Clint](../../../characters/party/clint.md) is L1 (he didn't choose a god for his Paladin class and couldn't level), [Vanessa](../../../characters/party/vanessa.md), [Rebekah](../../../characters/party/rebekah.md), and [Selene](../../../characters/party/selene.md) are L3 (from having to kill the guard at IQuantum), and [Wade](../../../characters/party/wade.md) is L5 (from additional XP healing kids and others). Wade immediately senses where his children are and rushes south, forcing the rest to follow with no weapons or equipment.

## Starter Content

Classic MMO starter quests:
- **Kill the rats in my basement** — literal sewer rats infesting residential buildings
- **Fetch quests** — deliver supplies between gathering points (food, water, medical)
- **Clear the building** — a block of apartments has Restless Dead; someone needs to clean it out
- **Sewer problems** — something big is living down there (Sewer Gator)

These quests are mundane but essential for the thousands of regular people trying to survive. Not everyone was a programmer with system access.

## Environmental Traits

- **Safe Zone:** No hostile mob spawns in the open. Combat only inside instanced locations.
- **High Enchanter Density:** SF's concentration of Bay Area tech workers means more enchanters and engineers per capita than most safe zones. Infrastructure recovery is faster here than elsewhere.
- **Gathering Points:** People cluster in large buildings (Moscone Center, public libraries, churches).
- **Recovering Infrastructure:** Cable cars running on mana, builder-mages reinforcing structures, magical lighting in key areas. Running water from gravity-fed systems supplemented by magical pumping. Food rationing ongoing, farming efforts beginning.

## Mob Roster

### Sewer Rat
- **Level:** 1-2 | **Role:** Minion
- **Theme:** Classic basement vermin. Packs of 4-6 in dark spaces.
- **Abilities:** Bite (minimal damage). Flee at low HP.
- **Notes:** The system's introductory enemy. Even untrained people can handle them with a stick.

### Giant Rat
- **Level:** 3 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** Pack leader. Larger, meaner, with matted fur and glowing eyes. Found deeper in the sewers.
- **Abilities:** Savage Bite (slightly harder hit), Rally Swarm (nearby Sewer Rats become more aggressive).
- **Notes:** First "real" fight for a normal person. For the party, one-hit kill.

### Feral Dog
- **Level:** 2-3 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** Abandoned pets gone wild. Hunting in packs of 2-4 in alleys and parks.
- **Abilities:** Pack Tactics (bonus damage when flanking with another dog).
- **Notes:** Sad but dangerous. Nobody wants to fight someone's former pet, but they'll eat you.

### Restless Dead
- **Level:** 3-4 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** People who died during the Transition and came back wrong. Not skeletons — recently dead, confused, stumbling. Some still wearing the clothes they died in.
- **Abilities:** Grasp (slow melee), Moan (minor fear effect on low-level players).
- **Notes:** Emotionally difficult for normal people — these were their neighbors. For the party, it's a grim reminder of what the Transition cost.

### Looter
- **Level:** 4-5 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** Humans who chose violence when the system went down. Armed with improvised weapons (bats, knives, pipes). Hostile on sight in certain parts of the city.
- **Abilities:** Cheap Shot (bonus damage on first hit from stealth), Intimidate (minor debuff).
- **Notes:** The first "human enemy" type. Morally uncomfortable. The system treats them as hostile combatants.

### Sewer Gator
- **Level:** 5 | **Role:** Elite
- **Theme:** Urban legend made real. A massive alligator living in the SF sewer system, grown large and aggressive with mana exposure. The sewer dungeon's boss.
- **Abilities:** Death Roll (grapple + high damage), Thick Hide (high AR, resistant to slashing).
- **Notes:** A genuine threat to L1-5 players. For the party, it's a fun fight but not dangerous. Could be a quest objective ("something's blocking the water flow in the main sewer line").

## Notable Locations

- **Moscone Center:** Primary gathering point. Functioning as a makeshift government/organization hub.
- **Golden Gate Park:** Visible from the city but L35 content — elves and dryads. Off limits for now.
- **The Sewers:** Dungeon-instanced. Rats, the Gator, and whatever else washed down there.
- **The Bridges:** Golden Gate (L50 Troll northbound) and Bay Bridge (L30 Troll eastbound). Visible barriers.

## Narrative Notes

The party is killed at [IQuantum](../../organizations/iquantum.md) during the Transition and respawns in San Francisco (Chapter 14). The city is chaotic — people are panicking, the system is new, nobody understands what happened. But [Wade](../../../characters/party/wade.md) can feel where his children are, somewhere to the south, and he won't wait. He rushes out of the safe zone with no weapons, no equipment, and no plan, forcing the rest of the party to follow.

They don't engage with the starter content. They don't gear up. They just run south — straight into the [Ruins](the-ruins.md) and mobs that are well above their level.

The contrast between the party (L1-5 with 999 HP but no gear and limited abilities) and normal people (L1 with no class and improvised weapons) establishes the power gap — but also shows that raw HP isn't enough when you're outnumbered and outleveled.
