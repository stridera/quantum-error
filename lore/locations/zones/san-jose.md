# San Jose — Goblin Encampment (L25)

The Book 1 capstone zone. The city of San Jose has been claimed by [Eron Vosk](../../../characters/villains/eron-vosk.md) and transformed into a fortified goblin encampment. This is the party's ultimate destination on the Peninsula corridor.

## Overview

San Jose is not a wilderness zone — it's an occupied city. Eron Vosk has organized thousands of goblins into a functioning military force, fortified key positions, and established a seat of power somewhere in the city's downtown core. The party has been seeing signs of this army since the Creeklands. Now they're at its gates.

## Level Range

**L25.** The highest-level zone in Book 1. Full goblin army — warriors, shamans, siege equipment, and Eron's inner circle.

## Key Figures

### Eron Vosk (Boss)
Goblin Warlord. [Clint](../../../characters/party/clint.md) turned him into a [Goblin](../../../races/goblin.md) during the Transition. He's built a goblin army in San Jose and commands it as a military dictator. Full encounter design TBD.

### Dan (Lieutenant)
[Troll](../../../races/troll.md) [Necromancer](../../../classes/necromancer.md). One of Eron's top members — not a goblin, but a troll. Raises undead troops for the goblin army. The *real* Dan, far more dangerous than the [Spirit Dungeon's](../../dungeons/spirit-dungeon.md) mannequin caricature of him.

### Eron's Lieutenants
Eron's pre-Transition followers who were transformed into goblins alongside him. They form his inner circle and command the goblin military's divisions.

## Narrative Notes

The Goblin Encampment is the culmination of Book 1's southward journey. Every goblin encounter from the Creeklands onward was foreshadowing this. The party has gone from fighting scouts to soldiers to an army — and now they're facing the warlord behind it all.

Full zone design — mob roster, encounter structure, boss fight, and loot — is deferred to a dedicated design pass.
