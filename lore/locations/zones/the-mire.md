# The Mire (Mountain View / Sunnyvale, L21-25)

The fifth and final outdoor zone before San Jose. The bay marshlands have expanded massively, swallowing the tech campuses and suburban neighborhoods of Mountain View and Sunnyvale. Half-submerged buildings, flooded parking lots, and stagnant water define the landscape. Goblin military presence is heavy — this is their territory.

## Description

Google, Apple, LinkedIn — the campuses that defined Silicon Valley are sinking. The bay marshlands at Shoreline have expanded miles inland, fed by mana-charged groundwater. What was flat suburban terrain is now a swamp. Roads disappear into murky water. Strip malls stand in two feet of standing water, their signs rusting. The Googleplex is a series of moss-covered islands connected by boardwalks that are slowly rotting.

The air is thick, hot, and smells like decay. Insects swarm in clouds. The water is opaque — you can't see what's beneath the surface, and something always is.

Goblin patrols are everywhere. This is the buffer zone between the wild Peninsula and [Eron Vosk's](../../../characters/villains/eron-vosk.md) fortress in San Jose. The goblins here aren't scouts or guerrillas — they're soldiers. Organized, equipped, and operating under orders.

## Level Range

**L21-25.** The highest-level overworld zone in Book 1. Swamp creatures and organized goblin military. The Swamp Naga is the zone's capstone at L24-25.

## Environmental Traits

- **Swamp Terrain:** Most of the zone is flooded. Movement is slowed in water. Deep sections require swimming. Solid ground is limited to raised roads, building foundations, and goblin-built platforms.
- **Concealment:** The murky water and dense vegetation provide excellent concealment for ambush predators. Bog Crocs and Lizardfolk use this constantly.
- **Goblin Infrastructure:** The goblins have built watchtowers, boardwalks, and fortified positions throughout the Mire. This isn't wilderness — it's occupied territory.
- **Mana Density:** Higher ambient mana than previous zones. Spellcasters may notice enhanced or unpredictable magical effects.

## Mob Roster

### Marsh Lizardfolk
- **Level:** 21-22 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** Reptilian humanoids, five to six feet tall, scaled, with webbed hands and feet. They're native to the expanded marshlands — not aligned with the goblins, not hostile to them either. Territorial and aggressive toward intruders.
- **Abilities:** Javelin Throw (ranged), Marsh Camouflage (ambush bonus from standing water — hard to spot until they move).
- **Notes:** The Lizardfolk are a neutral faction that the goblins coexist with. They attack the party because the party is in their territory, not because they're following Eron's orders. This distinction may matter narratively.

### Bog Croc
- **Level:** 22-23 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** A massive crocodile lurking in the flooded areas. Fifteen feet long, armored hide, patient. It waits in murky water for something to wade close. Then it strikes.
- **Abilities:** Ambush Lunge (first attack from water is guaranteed hit, high damage), Death Roll (grapple + sustained damage, STR check to escape).
- **Notes:** The swamp's ambush predator. You never see it coming — it's underwater until it isn't. Rewards scouting ahead (Selene) and avoiding deep water when possible. The Death Roll grapple is dangerous even with 999 HP because it prevents you from acting.

### Goblin Warrior
- **Level:** 22-24 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** Organized goblin soldiers. Armed with real weapons (short swords, shields, crossbows), wearing scavenged armor, operating in squads of 4-6. They patrol routes, man checkpoints, and respond to incursions with coordinated tactics.
- **Abilities:** Shield Wall (bonus AR when adjacent to another Goblin Warrior), Crossbow Volley (ranged attack, focused fire on a single target).
- **Notes:** These are not the scouts from the Creeklands or the guerrillas from the Deepwood. They're military. They fight in formation, focus fire, and retreat to reinforced positions when outmatched. The party is encountering an army.

### Goblin Shaman
- **Level:** 23-24 | **Role:** Elite
- **Theme:** Goblin spellcasters attached to warrior squads. Smaller, wearing bone fetishes and crude robes. They stand behind the shield wall and cast.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Hex Bolt:** Ranged spell attack — moderate damage + 4s debuff (-3 accuracy or -3 damage, randomly chosen).
  - **War Chant:** Buff — all goblin allies within 30 feet gain +2 damage for 10s. Maintained while the Shaman is alive and chanting.
- **Notes:** The force multiplier. A squad with a Shaman is significantly more dangerous than one without. The party should learn to prioritize the Shaman (kill the support). Mirrors the "kill the Alpha" lesson from the Coyotes but in a more sophisticated context.

### Will-o-Wisp
- **Level:** 24 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** A floating ball of pale light drifting through the swamp at dusk. Beautiful. Mesmerizing. It drifts away from safe ground, deeper into the water, and you follow it because you can't help it.
- **Abilities:** Lure (passive — characters within 40 feet make a Will save or are compelled to follow for 6s, moving toward deep water), Shock (if a lured character enters deep water, the Wisp deals arcane damage and the water does the rest).
- **Notes:** Environmental hazard more than a combat threat. The Lure is a mental effect — similar to Fascination from the Spirit Dungeon but used to drown you rather than distract you. [Wade's](../../../characters/party/wade.md) Bless helps resist it. The party has dealt with mental effects before — this tests whether they learned.

### Swamp Naga
- **Level:** 24-25 | **Role:** Champion
- **Theme:** A serpentine spellcaster — human upper body, massive snake lower body. Twenty feet long. Lives in the deepest part of the swamp, surrounded by mana-dense water. Controls the ecosystem around it. Not a goblin — an independent power that the goblins avoid.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Mana Torrent:** Channeled AoE spell — a wave of mana-charged water floods the area (damage + knockback + applies Waterlogged debuff: -25% movement, -2 accuracy for 8s).
  - **Serpent's Gaze:** Single-target charm (similar to Fascination, 8s, Will save to resist). Pulls the target toward the Naga.
  - **Tail Sweep:** Melee AoE — the massive tail sweeps everything in front (knockback + prone).
- **Notes:** The zone capstone. A Champion that controls the battlefield with water-based AoE and mental effects. The party needs everything they've learned: focus fire, break mental effects, positioning, and sustained DPS. This is the last major fight before San Jose.

## Notable Locations

- **Shoreline Amphitheatre:** The former concert venue is now an island in the marsh. Elevated ground. Could be a rally point or landmark.
- **The Googleplex Islands:** The former Google campus, now a cluster of moss-covered buildings connected by rotting boardwalks. Goblin patrols use it as a staging area.
- **Stevens Creek Trail:** A flooded trail corridor that runs south toward San Jose. The most direct route but heavily patrolled by goblin squads.
- **Moffett Field:** The former naval air station. Massive hangars standing in shallow water. Could be a dungeon — for now it's a distant, imposing landmark.

## Narrative Notes

The Mire is the "almost there" zone. San Jose is visible to the south — the goblin watchtowers, the lights from their camps. The party knows what's waiting for them.

The goblin military presence here transforms the journey from "exploring dangerous wilderness" to "pushing through enemy territory." The party is heading toward a confrontation with [Eron Vosk](../../../characters/villains/eron-vosk.md), and the Mire makes it clear that this is a war zone, not an adventure.

[Clint's](../../../characters/party/clint.md) house is in Sunnyvale — somewhere in this swamp. Whether the party detours to find it (or what's left of it) is a potential story beat.
