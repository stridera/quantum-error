# The Foglands (San Bruno / Millbrae, L9-13)

The second outdoor zone. San Bruno Mountain and the surrounding hills are blanketed in supernatural fog that never fully lifts. The terrain shifts from flat suburban decay to rolling hills, ravines, and ridge trails. Things hide in the mist.

## Description

The fog here isn't weather — it's the zone. Thick, wet, and faintly luminescent, it rolls down from San Bruno Mountain and fills every valley and ravine. Visibility drops to 30-50 feet in the lowlands and clears only on the highest ridgelines, where the wind keeps the air moving.

The landscape is hilly and uneven. The suburban buildings of San Bruno and Millbrae still stand on the lower slopes, but they're half-swallowed by fog and overgrowth. Roads wind up into the hills, cracked and buckled. The BART tracks run through here — rusted rails disappearing into fog-choked tunnels.

At the ridgelines, you can see in all directions. To the west, the mountain wall and the shadows beyond it. To the east, the gray expanse of the Bay. North, the glow of San Francisco's wards. South, the fog thickens — whatever's down there, you can't see it from here.

Something screams from the fog below. It might be a hawk. It might not be.

## Level Range

**L9-13.** Overworld mobs range from L9 fog predators to L13 fog elementals. The supernatural fog and hill terrain make this the most ambush-heavy zone in the early corridor.

## Environmental Traits

- **Supernatural Fog:** Persistent visibility reduction (30-50 feet in lowlands). Clears on ridgelines. Mobs adapted to the fog get ambush advantages.
- **Hill Terrain:** Elevation changes create natural choke points and vantage positions. High ground = better visibility. Low ground = fog and danger.
- **Wind Corridors:** Some ridge trails have consistent wind that keeps fog at bay — natural safe paths through the zone.
- **Fog Density Variation:** The fog shifts over time. Areas that were clear may fill in, and vice versa. The zone isn't static.

## Mob Roster

### Fog Stalker
- **Level:** 9-10 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** A lean, gray-furred predator — somewhere between a large cat and a wolf. Perfectly adapted to the fog. Its fur shifts to match the mist. You don't see it until it's on you.
- **Abilities:** Fog Ambush (first attack from fog has bonus damage + surprise), Fade (after attacking, retreats into fog and repositions).
- **Notes:** Hit-and-run predator. Frustrating to fight because it keeps disappearing. Rewards perception and AOE abilities that flush it out.

### Hill Boar
- **Level:** 10-11 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** Massive wild boar. Bristled, tusked, and territorial. Charges anything that enters its space. Found on hillsides and in clearings.
- **Abilities:** Charge (closes distance rapidly, bonus damage + knockback), Thick Hide (above-average AR).
- **Notes:** Straightforward brute. The charge is telegraphed — it lowers its head and paws the ground. Dodgeable if you're paying attention. Dangerous if it catches you on a slope (knockback sends you tumbling downhill).

### Hawk Harpy
- **Level:** 11-12 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** A bird-human hybrid nesting on the ridgeline crags. Human torso, hawk wings and talons. Swoops from above, strikes, and retreats to altitude. Calls to others with piercing shrieks.
- **Abilities:** Diving Strike (aerial attack, bonus damage from height), Shriek (alerts nearby Harpies within social aggro radius).
- **Notes:** Aerial enemies. The party's first encounter with something they can't just melee — need ranged attacks or abilities to deal with them effectively. [Vanessa's](../../../characters/party/vanessa.md) spells shine here.

### Phase Spider
- **Level:** 12 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** A spider that phases in and out of visibility, using the fog as a medium. One moment it's a shimmer in the mist, the next it's on your face. Web traps materialize from the fog.
- **Abilities:** Phase Shift (50% miss chance for 1 round after repositioning), Fog Web (creates web trap that's nearly invisible in the fog — root on contact).
- **Notes:** Teaches awareness. The webs are hard to see in the fog — [Selene](../../../characters/party/selene.md) scouting ahead can spot them. Phase Shift makes it annoying to pin down.

### Fog Elemental
- **Level:** 12-13 | **Role:** Elite
- **Theme:** A condensed mass of supernatural fog given form. Vaguely humanoid, constantly shifting. It doesn't walk — it flows. Cold radiates from its core. The zone's apex predator.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Blinding Mist:** AoE that reduces visibility to 5 feet for all entities in a 30-foot radius for 6s. Everyone is effectively blind.
  - **Chilling Touch:** Melee attack that deals cold damage and slows movement speed by 25% for 4s.
- **Notes:** The zone's Elite. Blinding Mist is the real threat — it removes the party's ability to coordinate. [Wade](../../../characters/party/wade.md) can't heal what he can't see. [Rebekah](../../../characters/party/rebekah.md) can't target songs. Fighting blind teaches the party to stay close and call out positions.

## Notable Locations

- **San Bruno Mountain:** The zone's central landmark. Ridge trails offer the best visibility and wind corridors. Hawk Harpy nesting territory on the upper crags.
- **Millbrae BART Station:** A fog-choked tunnel entrance. Dark, abandoned, rails rusting. Could be a future dungeon — for now it's atmosphere and a landmark.
- **Skyline Overlook:** A ridgeline vantage point where you can see the mountain wall to the west and dragons circling beyond. A natural rest point with wind keeping the fog clear.

## Narrative Notes

The fog introduces a new layer of overworld gameplay: visibility management. The party can't just charge through — they need to navigate fog density, use ridgeline paths, and deal with ambush predators that exploit low visibility. This contrasts with the Ruins' open suburban terrain.

By the time the party reaches the Foglands, they've cleared the [Spirit Dungeon](../../dungeons/spirit-dungeon.md) in the Ruins and have real gear and levels. The Foglands test whether they've learned to scout, coordinate, and fight smart — but now in conditions where they can barely see.
