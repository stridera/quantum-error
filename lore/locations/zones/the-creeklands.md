# The Creeklands (San Mateo / Belmont, L13-17)

The third outdoor zone. The creek corridors and storm channels of San Mateo and Belmont are swelling with mana-charged water. The foothills are becoming overgrown with aggressive vegetation. This is the transition zone — "nature is winning" replaces "civilization is crumbling."

## Description

The flat suburban streets of San Mateo give way to creek corridors that have burst their concrete channels. Mana-infused water floods streets, parks, and basements. The creeks that were once tidy municipal waterways are now wild streams cutting new paths through neighborhoods, carrying debris and strange life.

The foothills to the west are thick with new growth — not just weeds, but actual forest establishing itself in what was residential landscape. Trees that should take decades to mature are head-height in months. Vines cover everything. The boundary between "town" and "wilderness" is dissolving.

The air is humid. Everything smells like wet earth and green growth. Insects buzz in clouds. Frogs chorus from every flooded lot.

First goblin sightings occur here — small scouting parties moving north from San Jose, probing the territory.

## Level Range

**L13-17.** Aquatic and plant-based threats dominate, with goblin scouts appearing in the L14-15 range.

## Environmental Traits

- **Flooding:** Streets and low-lying areas are ankle-to-knee-deep in water. Movement is slowed in flooded terrain. Some areas require swimming.
- **Overgrowth:** Vegetation is aggressively reclaiming buildings. Line of sight is increasingly limited by foliage. Ambush terrain.
- **Creek Corridors:** The old storm channels are natural pathways — faster travel but exposed. Mobs patrol them.
- **Mud:** Soft ground in flooded areas. Heavy characters (armor, equipment) may sink or get stuck briefly.

## Mob Roster

### Creek Toad
- **Level:** 13-14 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** A large amphibious predator the size of a large dog. Sits motionless in flooded areas until something wades close. Explosive lunge.
- **Abilities:** Tongue Grab (ranged pull — yanks target into melee range from 15 feet), Swallow Attempt (small targets only — mainly a threat to animals and minions).
- **Notes:** Ambush predator. Hard to spot in murky water. The tongue grab is jarring — you're walking through a flooded lot and suddenly something pulls you sideways.

### Vine Strangler
- **Level:** 14-15 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** Animated plant growth in the creek corridors. Looks like a dense mass of vines and creepers until it moves. Roots and constricts anything that enters its space.
- **Abilities:** Entangle (root — vines wrap around legs, 4s duration), Constrict (sustained damage to rooted targets, 5 dmg/2s).
- **Notes:** Area denial. The Vine Strangler doesn't chase — it sits in a corridor and makes you deal with it. Fire is effective (burn the vines). Teaches the party to identify threats before walking into them.

### Goblin Scout
- **Level:** 14-15 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** Small scouting parties of 2-3 [goblins](../../../races/goblin.md) moving north from San Jose. Lightly armed, cautious, more interested in observing than fighting. They'll fight if cornered but prefer to flee and report.
- **Abilities:** Shortbow (ranged attack, low damage), Scatter (when one is killed, the others flee in different directions).
- **Notes:** First goblin encounter. Foreshadows San Jose. If the party lets one escape, it reports back — no immediate consequences, but it establishes that the goblins know they're coming. The party may not even realize these are connected to [Eron Vosk](../../../characters/villains/eron-vosk.md) yet.

### Water Sprite
- **Level:** 15 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** A minor water elemental — a shimmering, translucent figure that rises from flooded areas. About two feet tall. Annoying, evasive, and slippery.
- **Abilities:** Water Jet (ranged attack, knocks target back), Dissolve (when threatened in melee, melts into the water and repositions 20 feet away).
- **Notes:** Hard to pin down. Low damage but frustrating. Dissolve makes it resistant to melee — ranged and AoE abilities are more effective. The party may spend more effort chasing it than the fight is worth.

### Creek Serpent
- **Level:** 15-16 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** A large water snake, 10-15 feet long, living in the expanded creek corridors. Ambushes from underwater.
- **Abilities:** Constrict (grapple + sustained damage), Submerge (retreats underwater for repositioning, brief stealth).
- **Notes:** Aquatic ambush predator. Dangerous in the water where it has the advantage. On land, it's slow and vulnerable. The creek corridors are its territory — avoid them, or clear them.

### Mud Golem
- **Level:** 16-17 | **Role:** Elite
- **Theme:** A humanoid figure formed from the creek bed mud. Seven feet tall, dense, slow. It doesn't speak. It just moves toward you with the inevitability of erosion.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Mud Regeneration:** Regenerates 5% HP per round while standing in water or mud. Must be fought on dry ground or killed fast.
  - **Slam:** Heavy melee attack with knockback. Sends targets into the water (where the golem is strongest).
- **Notes:** The zone's Elite. The regeneration mechanic forces the party to either pull it onto dry ground (tactical positioning) or burst it down before regen outpaces their damage. Teaches fight-the-environment thinking.

## Notable Locations

- **San Mateo Creek Corridor:** The main waterway through the zone. Wide, fast-moving, full of life. Natural travel route but heavily patrolled by aquatic mobs.
- **Belmont Foothills:** The western edge of the zone where the vegetation is thickest. Transition into proto-forest. The mountain wall is closer here.
- **Ralston Avenue Bridge:** A partially collapsed overpass that serves as a natural chokepoint and landmark. Goblin scouts have been seen near here.

## Narrative Notes

The Creeklands mark a shift in the story's environment. The party is no longer in "ruins" — they're in a landscape being actively transformed by mana. Nature isn't just reclaiming the old world, it's building something new.

The goblin scouts are the first sign that something organized exists to the south. The party may encounter them as enemies, or they may spot them watching from a distance and retreating. Either way, the goblins know the party is heading south.
