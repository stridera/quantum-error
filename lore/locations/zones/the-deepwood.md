# The Deepwood (Redwood City / Palo Alto, L17-21)

The fourth outdoor zone. The redwood forests are growing at supernatural speed, swallowing neighborhoods, tech campuses, and highways. Dense canopy blocks the sky. The understory is dark, tangled, and full of life that wasn't here a month ago.

## Description

This used to be Redwood City and Palo Alto — tech campuses, coffee shops, tree-lined residential streets. Now the trees have won. Actual redwoods, accelerated by mana, have grown from saplings to towering giants in weeks. Their canopy is so dense that the forest floor exists in perpetual twilight.

Buildings are being consumed. A house becomes a tree-wrapped ruin. A parking garage becomes a terraced cliff of concrete and roots. The 101 freeway is a canyon of cracked asphalt with trees growing through the median.

The air is cool, damp, and smells like redwood bark. Sounds carry strangely under the canopy — footsteps echo, branches creak without wind, and something large moves through the upper canopy on occasion.

Goblin presence increases significantly here. Forest-adapted goblin groups use the dense terrain for ambush tactics.

## Level Range

**L17-21.** Forest creatures and goblins dominate. The Owlbear is the zone's capstone threat at L21.

## Environmental Traits

- **Dense Canopy:** Perpetual twilight at ground level. Reduced visibility (40-60 feet). Aerial observation is blocked.
- **Root Networks:** The ground is uneven with massive root systems. Trip hazards. Difficult terrain for mounted or heavy movement.
- **Vertical Space:** The redwoods are climbable. Some threats come from above (spiders, goblins in the canopy). Height advantage is available for those who use it.
- **Sound Distortion:** The canopy creates unusual acoustics. Sounds carry farther than expected in some directions, are muffled in others. Social aggro radius is unpredictable.

## Mob Roster

### Dire Wolf
- **Level:** 17-18 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** Wolves that have claimed the new forest. Larger than pre-Transition wolves, with mana-bright eyes. They hunt in packs of 3-4 and are intelligent enough to set simple ambushes.
- **Abilities:** Pack Takedown (if 2+ wolves are on the same target, one attempts a knockdown), Howl (alerts pack members — social aggro, not summoning like the Coyote Alpha).
- **Notes:** Upgraded version of the coyote packs from the Ruins. Smarter, tougher, but no summoning mechanic. The party should handle these confidently by now.

### Briar Spider
- **Level:** 18-19 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** Giant spiders that build web traps between trees. Their webs incorporate thorny vines from the undergrowth, making them both sticky and painful. Body size of a large dog.
- **Abilities:** Thorn Web (web trap between trees — root + 3 dmg/round from thorns), Venomous Bite (melee + poison DoT).
- **Notes:** Area denial through web placement. [Selene](../../../characters/party/selene.md) scouting ahead can spot webs. Fire destroys them but risks setting the undergrowth ablaze. Similar to the Spirit Dungeon's Giant Spider Prop but in an open environment.

### Forest Goblin
- **Level:** 18-20 | **Role:** Normal
- **Theme:** [Goblins](../../../races/goblin.md) who've adapted to the Deepwood. They use the canopy and undergrowth for ambush tactics — dropping from trees, shooting from concealment, fleeing into dense brush. Better equipped and trained than the Creeklands scouts.
- **Abilities:** Canopy Drop (attacks from above — bonus damage, brief stun on landing), Guerrilla Retreat (flees into undergrowth when outnumbered, hard to track).
- **Notes:** The goblin escalation continues. These aren't scouts — they're fighters. They attack in groups of 3-5 with coordination. The party starts to understand that the goblins are an organized force, not random monsters.

### Treant Sapling
- **Level:** 19-20 | **Role:** Elite
- **Theme:** A young treant — a tree that moves. Twelve feet tall, bark-armored, with branch-arms that swing like clubs. It moves slowly but is incredibly durable. It's not evil — it's territorial. The forest is its domain.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Root Slam:** Melee attack that causes roots to erupt from the ground around the target (AoE root, 3s).
  - **Bark Armor:** Very high AR. Resistant to slashing and piercing damage. Vulnerable to fire and axes.
- **Notes:** The zone's Elite. A wall of HP and armor. The party can't just DPS through it quickly — they need to exploit its fire vulnerability or bring axes. Teaches "some enemies require specific approaches." Slow enough that the party can disengage if they need to.

### Owlbear
- **Level:** 21 | **Role:** Champion
- **Theme:** A massive creature with the body of a bear and the head of an owl. Eight feet tall, 800+ lbs. Nests in the hollow bases of the largest redwoods. Territorial, aggressive, and incredibly powerful. The forest's apex predator.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Beak Rend:** Devastating bite attack (Champion-tier damage).
  - **Bear Hug:** Grapple + sustained crushing damage. Hard to escape (STR check, high DC).
  - **Territorial Roar:** AoE fear on detection — warns everything in the area that this is its territory.
- **Notes:** The zone capstone. A Champion-tier enemy that requires the full party's coordination. The Owlbear is not something you stumble into casually — its Territorial Roar announces it. Smart parties prepare before engaging. This is preparation for the Champion-tier Skeleton Puppets in the Spirit Dungeon's boss fight (if they haven't done it yet) or reinforces those lessons.

## Notable Locations

- **The Canopy Highway:** The upper branches of the largest redwoods form a navigable network above the forest floor. Goblins use it. The party could too, if they climb.
- **Stanford Overgrowth:** The former Stanford University campus, now consumed by the forest. Massive buildings half-buried in roots and foliage. Could be a dungeon in future content — libraries full of pre-Transition knowledge, labs with preserved equipment.
- **The 101 Canyon:** The freeway corridor, cracked open by tree roots. A natural travel route through the zone — faster than the forest floor but more exposed.

## Narrative Notes

The Deepwood is where the world fully commits to fantasy. There's nothing suburban left — it's a primal forest that happens to have concrete ruins buried in it. The party is deep in monster territory now.

The goblin presence here is the strongest signal yet that San Jose is ahead. Forest Goblins are organized and dangerous. The party may capture one and learn about [Eron Vosk's](../../../characters/villains/eron-vosk.md) army.
