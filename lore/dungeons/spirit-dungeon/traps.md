## Bear Trap (Trick Trap)

Looks like a normal bear trap. Triggering it causes a full-grown **Level 10 bear** to drop from above and immediately attack.

- **Trigger:** Step on / interact without disarming
- **Telegraph:** faint chain rattle, ceiling scuffs, too-clean pressure plate
- **Disarm:** standard trap disarm (difficulty: moderate for Level 10)

**On Trigger**
- **Impact Hit:** 1 × heavy physical hit on the triggering character.
- **Spawn:** Summons "Falling Bear (Level 10)" into the room with immediate aggro on the trigger.

**Falling Bear (Level 10)**
- Role: Bruiser
- Behavior: focuses the triggering target for 2 rounds before retargeting normally.

> TODO: convert to full numeric damage + stun/knockdown chance once combat math is finalized in `system/combat.md`.
