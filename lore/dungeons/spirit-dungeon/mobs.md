## Halloween Mannequin (Level 10)

A motionless figure dressed to kill—literally. When it moves, it's always half a beat late… or early.

- **Role:** Bruiser / Ambusher
- **Tell:** Plastic joints creak; head turns without body movement.
- **Signature:** sudden lunges from "stillness."

**Combat Notes**
- High opening burst, then steadier pressure.
- Resistant to mind effects (it's a "prop" until it isn't).

## Scream Mask Mannequin (Level 10)

A mannequin in a stretched scream mask, clutching a dull prop knife that becomes sharp when you look away.

- **Role:** DPS / Pressure
- **Signature:** panic escalation and quick punctures.

**Ability: Panic Cut**
- Deals moderate physical damage.
- If the target is already affected by a fear/charm effect, damage increases.

## Pinhead Mask Mannequin (Level 10)

A mannequin wearing a pin-studded mask; when it speaks, your thoughts line up like nails.

- **Role:** Caster / Control
- **Signature:** mental pressure and fixation.

**Ability: Fascination**
- Applies a charm-like fixation debuff. See `lore/dungeons/spirit-dungeon/effects.md`.
