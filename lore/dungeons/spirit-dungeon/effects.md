# Spirit Dungeon — Effects

Effects in the Spirit Dungeon are designed to feel *psychological* but still produce clean, readable system output.

## Fascination

A charm effect that makes the target feel there's hidden truth or power in the caster—something they could understand if they just focused.

- **Type:** Mental / Charm
- **Duration:** 10 seconds (or until broken)
- **Break Conditions:** line-of-sight break, hard interruption (shove/taunt), or forced movement

**Mechanics**
- Target is **Compelled** to maintain attention on the caster.
- Target suffers **-80% threat generation** toward non-caster enemies (they "don't care").
- Target has a **50% chance** to fail to select a non-caster target each action (wastes selection; does not consume the action if overridden by ally intervention).

**Cinematic Tell**
- Eyes track the caster; attacks feel "unimportant."
- Allies can snap them out by stepping into view or breaking eye contact.

> TODO: once `system/effects.md` is expanded, encode Fascination in the canonical effect taxonomy and add UI popup text format.
