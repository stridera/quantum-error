# Spirit Dungeon (Level 10)

Much like the store, **Spirit Dungeons** can pop up almost anywhere — abandoned malls, empty lots, closed storefronts, even as a "temporary wing" attached to an existing dungeon. They are themed around horror tropes, cheap plastic props, fog machines, and the uncomfortable truth that "sexy" and "deadly" are not mutually exclusive in this world.

The party's first Spirit Dungeon is a post-Transition Spirit Halloween store in the Bay Area (Chapters 15-16). They enter at levels 1-3 with boosted 999 HP/Mana but very few abilities, and level to ~L5 during the run.

## Core Rules

- **Level:** 10 (baseline). Boss room spikes higher for short windows.
- **Tone:** Trick-or-treat taken literally — rewards are real, but so are the "tricks."
- **Reality Fidelity:** Props snap into lethal authenticity once combat begins. A plastic scythe is real when it's swinging at you.
- **Fear Economy:** The dungeon rewards composure and punishes fixation, panic, and tunnel vision.
- **Respawn:** Entry mannequins respawn with different costumes if the party retreats to the vestibule. Other mobs do not respawn.
- **Exit:** Outer doors lock on entry. The dungeon must be completed (boss defeated) to leave.

## Environmental Traits

- **Strobe/Fog:** Periodic visibility penalties and accuracy reductions throughout.
- **Prop-Spawn:** Decorative objects become real weapons or hazards during combat.
- **Audio Lures:** Whispers and music-box loops may trigger attention-based effects.
- **Progressive Activation:** In the Seasonal Showroom, display sets activate as the party moves through them, layering hazards.

## Narrative Arcs

Three comedy/character arcs thread through the dungeon:

1. **Clint's Wardrobe:** Clothes burned (Room 1) → towel → Scream Robe → proper outfit (Room 2).
2. **Selene vs Mimics:** Spots obvious mimic (Room 3, "I'd never fall for that") → hidden mimics catch the party (Room 4) → dives into mimic couch (Room 5).
3. **Wade's Nurse Cap:** Sexy Nurse drops a healing-buff cap (Room 1). Wade wears it. Running gag.

## Design Philosophy

This dungeon is a **tutorial**. The party has overwhelming stats (999 HP) but almost no abilities or coordination. Each room teaches a concept:

- **Room 1:** Basic combat, friendly fire, CC mechanics, multi-threat management
- **Room 2:** Identity, mirror combat
- **Room 3:** Positioning, environmental awareness, three Elite archetypes (heavy hitter, forced engagement, anti-CC)
- **Room 4:** Scouting, ambush survival, tight-space tactics, mimic paranoia
- **Room 5:** Comedy relief before the boss
- **Room 6:** Everything combined — tanking, healing, DPS race, debuff management

The party walks in as five individuals with overpowered stats. They walk out as a team.
