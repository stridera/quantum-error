# Spirit Dungeon (Level 10)

> **Status:** DRAFT
> **Last Reviewed:** 2026-02-05

Much like the store, **Spirit Dungeons** can pop up almost anywhere—abandoned malls, empty lots, closed storefronts, even as a "temporary wing" attached to an existing dungeon.

They are themed around horror tropes, cheap plastic props, fog machines, and the uncomfortable truth that **"sexy" and "deadly" are not mutually exclusive** in this world.

## Core Rules
- **Level:** 10 (baseline). Boss rooms may spike higher for short windows.
- **Tone:** Trick-or-treat taken literally—rewards are real, but so are the "tricks."
- **Reality Fidelity:** Props can "snap into" lethal authenticity once combat begins.
- **Fear Economy:** The dungeon rewards composure and punishes fixation, panic, and tunnel vision.

## Environmental Traits
- **Strobe/Fog:** periodic visibility penalties and target misreads.
- **Prop-Spawn:** disposable objects become real weapons or hazards during combat ticks.
- **Audio Lures:** whispers, music-box loops, and distant screams may trigger attention-based effects.
