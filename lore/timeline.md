# Timeline

Key events in chronological order.

## Part 1: Pre-Transition (Modern Day)

### The Discovery
- **Chapter 1**: During a D&D session at IQuantum, Clint discovers an anomaly in the quantum computer tests—a bug that breaks the laws of physics. Investigation reveals they exist within a computer simulation, and the anomaly provides direct access to simulation data. Dan (VP of Technology) is briefed and leaves, disturbed.

### Exploration & Experimentation
- **Chapter 2**: The party (Clint, Wade, Rebekah, Dustin/Selene, Vanessa) begins analyzing the system. They discover it contains information about themselves and the world—genetic data for all entities. Wade reveals his daughter is terminally ill.
- **Chapter 3**: They locate Wade's daughter's genetic data but realize editing it is dangerous (risk of "segfaulting" the simulation). Wade is called to say goodbye to his daughter in ICU. Clint experiments on himself, setting his template to "superhero"—transforms briefly into human flame, gets severely burned.
- **Chapter 4**: Vanessa arrives and sets Clint to "RPG" template instead, triggering class selection. Clint chooses Paladin. Vanessa boosts his HP to heal him, then converts herself (Sorceress). Wade's daughter goes into cardiac arrest; they convert her to RPG, fix her HP, remove disease debuff. Both twins saved. Luck set to 20.
- **Chapter 5**: Party explores the new system. World is a Null Mana Zone—mana won't regenerate, but they can manually reset via system editor.

### Escalation
- **Chapter 6**: Dan returns demanding access, having contacted Eron Vosk. Dustin (CLO) threatens legal action for NDA breach. Party regroups at Dustin's friend's house.
- **Chapter 7**: Everyone converts to RPG and chooses classes. They begin stat boosting (slowly, to avoid side effects). Wade returns home.
- **Chapter 8**: Clint crafts legendary equipment (sword, shield, fanny pack of holding). Wade triggers failsafe code—something bad is happening. Clint confronts armed men.

### First Combat
- **Chapter 9**: Party's first real fight. Despite gunfire, their massive HP pools (999) let them survive. Dustin is identified as "Selene" (Nekara/catgirl race)—trans reveal. They flee using Rebekah's veil song.
- **Chapter 10**: Clint uses shield's return-damage ability to defeat armed attackers. They commandeer a van. Vanessa enters Severe Mana Lock (set mana to 99,999 instead of 999)—gains Mana Lucent but now has glowing veins/eyes permanently.

### Rescue & Confrontation
- **Chapter 11**: Party infiltrates compound where Wade is held prisoner. Clint's low luck causes him to fumble, alerting Dan and guards.
- **Chapter 12**: Party frees Wade. Dan firmly on team evil. They head to IQuantum HQ to access the system.
- **Chapter 13**: Eron Vosk confronts them outside HQ. Standoff. Party enters building. Vanessa is killed by sniper headshot. Others are overwhelmed.

### The Transition
- **Chapter 13 (cont)**: Clint, at the quantum computer, makes final changes:
  1. Changes Eron's race to Goblin
  2. Checks "Exempt from normal restraints" for party members
  3. Changes world template from Technology → RPG

  Mana begins regenerating. The quantum computer displays "Simulation corruption detected. Reset?" before dying. A **World Quest** appears: an artifact will destroy existence in 10 years unless the world boss guarding it is defeated. The quantum computer transforms into the **Tablet of Annihilation**. An **Ancient Red Dragon** destroys the building. Clint (luck still at 4) dies to dragon fire.

## Part 2: Post-Transition (Chapters 14-16+)

### Respawn & Reunion
- **Chapter 14**: Clint respawns in San Francisco (Safe Zone) wearing basic white clothes but still has his soulbound fanny pack. Party reunites. Wade runs off to find his family. Mobs appear at level 5+ outside safe zones. Clint still can't use Paladin abilities (needs to align with a god). God Strider has been petitioning him. Clint passes out from system overload.
- **Chapter 15**: Party takes refuge in a Spirit Halloween store (now a dungeon). Clint accepts Strider as his god, becoming **Paladin of the System**. Gains system-related abilities including System Identify.
- **Chapter 16**: Party learns to fight together. Clint reaches level 3, gains access to auras. They progress through the dungeon toward the boss.

### Training Arc
- Party completes the Spirit Halloween dungeon; Clint receives an engraver tool
- Party returns to San Francisco to regroup
- They learn a hard lesson: mobs outside the safe zone are too powerful (level 10+)
- Party trains, equips, and prepares—running dungeons for materials and experience
- Clint uses Enchanting to improve party gear
- Wade struggles to stay patient while Amanda and the twins remain captive

### The Rescue Mission
- Party locates Eron's goblin encampment
- They discover Amanda is under Eron's mind control (Mind Mage abilities)
- First rescue attempt fails when Amanda, still controlled, raises the alarm
- Clint's Paladin aura and Rebekah's songs protect the party from mind control
- The twins, due to their Luck 20, have been taken in by wolves—developing druid/hunter abilities

### Final Confrontation (Part 3)
- Party gathers intelligence on Eron's stronghold
- Eron has created a **Null Magic Zone**—if they die inside, no respawn
- Selene, Rebekah, and Vanessa use artifacts to protect against mind control
- Party discovers the Null Magic Zone can break Eron's hold on Amanda
- Amanda is freed and joins the party temporarily for Clint's protective aura
- Final battle against Level 25 Goblin Warlord Eron Vosk
- Party reaches approximately Level 20 by end of Book I
- Eron defeated; goblin camp falls into disarray

### Epilogue
- Party returns to San Francisco with Wade's family reunited
- Wade decides to step away from adventuring to be with Amanda and the twins
- Party learns of a fae waypoint in Golden Gate Park, protected by a boss
- Access to the waypoint would open travel to distant locations
- World Quest remains: 10 years to defeat the Ancient Red Dragon

## World State Post-Transition

- Technology no longer functions
- Mana floods the world
- Safe Zones (like San Francisco) remain relatively stable
- Monster levels increase farther from safe zones
- Party members can sense each other's locations
- Family members can sense each other
- World Quest active: defeat world boss in 10 years or existence ends
- Eron Vosk becomes Level 25 Goblin Warlord (Book I final boss)
- Ancient Red Dragon at Dragon Nest (Saratoga, Level 99)
