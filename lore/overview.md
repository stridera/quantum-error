# Lore Overview

Every culture ends up pondering one question as they advance far enough: Are we in a simulation? The simple answer is yes.

Quantum Error is a LitRPG novel revolving around a group of programmers and scientists who stumble upon an anomaly, granting them access to the keys of the universe.

The novel begins in the modern-day Bay Area and quickly switches to a post-magic world with monsters, goblins, and dragons.

## The Transition

The world undergoes a fundamental change from mundane reality to a magic-infused RPG system. Technology everywhere fails as mana floods the world.

## Setting

Primary location: San Francisco Bay Area, California

### Pre-Transition
- [IQuantum](organizations/iquantum.md) headquarters in Saratoga
- Clint's House in Sunnyvale
- Friend's House in Mountain View
- Vanessa's House in San Francisco

### Post-Transition
Safe zones like San Francisco remain relatively stable, while outlying areas become dangerous wastelands filled with monsters.

Notable post-transition zones:
- **Golden Gate Park** — Level 35, featuring elves and dryads
- **Dragon Nest (near Saratoga)** — Level 99 endgame zone with an Ancient Red Dragon
