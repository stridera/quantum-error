# Lore Overview

Every culture ends up pondering one question as they advance far enough: Are we in a simulation? The simple answer is yes.

Quantum Error is a LitRPG novel revolving around a group of programmers and scientists who stumble upon an anomaly, granting them access to the keys of the universe.

The novel begins in the modern-day Bay Area and quickly switches to a post-magic world with monsters, goblins, and dragons.

## The Transition

The world undergoes a fundamental change from mundane reality to a magic-infused RPG system. Technology everywhere fails as mana floods the world.

### Immediate Effects

All electricity ceases to function. Cars, phones, lights, computers, medical equipment — everything electronic dies simultaneously. Infrastructure begins to degrade. Without climate control, pumping systems, and active maintenance, modern buildings start failing.

### Safe Zones

Major cities become safe zones — protected areas where hostile mobs don't spawn in the open. These are humanity's footholds. Outside the safe zones, the world is dangerous and getting worse.

### Profession Translation

People keep the skills they had before the Transition. The system recognizes pre-existing competence and translates it into profession ranks with corresponding magical abilities:

- **Builders, structural engineers, architects** gain fortification magic — the ability to magically reinforce walls, foundations, and structures. Buildings that should collapse within weeks are stabilized and improved. This is why the safe zones don't crumble.
- **Programmers** become [Enchanters](../professions/enchanting.md) — able to inscribe magical pathways into objects. Senior developers become master enchanters. The logic and systems thinking that made them good programmers maps directly to enchantment design.
- **Engineers** (class TBD) gain abilities to interface magic with mechanical systems. Between engineers and enchanters, they get vehicles and infrastructure running on mana instead of electricity.
- **Blacksmiths, craftspeople** gain magic tied to their craft — heat manipulation, material shaping, precision work. [Celeste](../characters/supporting/celeste.md) is an example: a blacksmith who gained magical metalworking, partnered with her enchanter husband to forge and enchant weapons.
- **Doctors, nurses, healers** — translation TBD, but medical knowledge maps to healing-adjacent abilities.

Skill level translates directly. A journeyman carpenter becomes a journeyman builder-mage. A senior developer becomes a master enchanter. **Grandmaster** rank is beyond normal translation — it requires quests, rare materials, and system-recognized mastery. [Clint](../characters/party/clint.md) hacked his way to Grandmaster Enchanter, giving him the skill to create legendary enchantments without having done any of the work.

### Recovery

Safe zones don't just survive — they adapt. Within weeks, builder-mages stabilize critical infrastructure. Enchanters and engineers get essential systems running on mana: water pumping, transportation, lighting. Cable cars, some vehicles, and basic utilities come back online — powered by magic instead of electricity. The speed of recovery varies by city and by how many skilled professionals survived the Transition.

## Setting

Primary location: [San Francisco Bay Area](locations/bay-area.md), California

### Pre-Transition
- [IQuantum](organizations/iquantum.md) headquarters in Saratoga
- [Clint's](../characters/party/clint.md) House in Sunnyvale
- Friend's House in Mountain View
- [Vanessa's](../characters/party/vanessa.md) House in San Francisco

### Post-Transition
Safe zones like San Francisco remain relatively stable, while outlying areas become dangerous wastelands filled with monsters. The party travels south from SF through a [Peninsula corridor](locations/bay-area.md) of increasingly dangerous zones, leveling from 1 to 25 over the course of Book 1.

**Book 1 Zones (L1-25):**
- [San Francisco](locations/zones/san-francisco.md) — Safe zone, L1-5 starter content
- [The Ruins](locations/zones/the-ruins.md) — South SF / Daly City, L5-9
- [The Foglands](locations/zones/the-foglands.md) — San Bruno / Millbrae, L9-13
- [The Creeklands](locations/zones/the-creeklands.md) — San Mateo / Belmont, L13-17
- [The Deepwood](locations/zones/the-deepwood.md) — Redwood City / Palo Alto, L17-21
- [The Mire](locations/zones/the-mire.md) — Mountain View / Sunnyvale, L21-25
- [San Jose](locations/zones/san-jose.md) — Goblin Encampment, L25 (Book 1 capstone)

**Future Zones:**
- **Golden Gate Park** — L35, featuring elves and dryads
- **East Bay** (beyond Bay Bridge) — L30+ zones, future books
- **North Bay** (beyond Golden Gate) — L50+ zones, future books
- **Dragon Territory** (west of Skyline) — L90-99 endgame, Ancient Red Dragon near Saratoga
