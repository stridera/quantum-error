# Enchanting

Enchanting is the programming of the new world—creating magical pathways in items to channel mana. It requires skilled artificers, blacksmiths, or woodworkers.

## Core Concepts

### Item Awareness
Items develop rudimentary awareness. Enchantments teach them skills over time.

### Active Abilities
Active abilities function as mana channels, allowing non-casters to use specific spells (though less powerfully than actual casters).

### Amplifiers
Amplifiers boost spells beyond normal limitations.

### Power Sources
Power derives from:
- Materials used
- Creator skill
- Enchanter ability

### Limitations
Enchantments fail in Null Mana Zones.

## Skill Translation

The system recognized pre-Transition competence. Programmers — people who already understood logic, systems, and structured problem-solving — became Enchanters. Their skill level translated directly:

| Pre-Transition Experience | Enchanting Rank |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Junior developer | Apprentice Enchanter |
| Mid-level developer | Journeyman Enchanter |
| Senior developer | Master Enchanter |
| Staff / Principal | Master Enchanter (high) |

**Grandmaster** rank is beyond what normal skill translation provides. It requires extensive quests, rare materials, and system-recognized mastery. [Clint](../characters/party/clint.md) bypassed this entirely by hacking the system — he has Grandmaster rank (and the ability to create legendary enchantments) without having done any of the work. He has the skill, if not the materials.

## Practitioners

- [Clint](../characters/party/clint.md) — Grandmaster (hacked)
- [Celeste's](../characters/supporting/celeste.md) husband — Enchanter (rank TBD), works with Celeste to enchant her forged weapons
