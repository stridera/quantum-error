# Enchanting

Enchanting is the programming of the new world—creating magical pathways in items to channel mana. It requires skilled artificers, blacksmiths, or woodworkers.

## Core Concepts

### Item Awareness
Items develop rudimentary awareness. Enchantments teach them skills over time.

### Active Abilities
Active abilities function as mana channels, allowing non-casters to use specific spells (though less powerfully than actual casters).

### Amplifiers
Amplifiers boost spells beyond normal limitations.

### Power Sources
Power derives from:
- Materials used
- Creator skill
- Enchanter ability

### Limitations
Enchantments fail in Null Mana Zones.
