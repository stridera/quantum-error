# Simulation Layer

> **SPOILER WARNING:** This file contains author-level knowledge about the nature of the simulation. Characters do not know this information in Book 1. Reading this file will spoil reveals from later books. If you're here for Book 1 mechanics and stats, turn back.

## The Simulation

The world of Quantum Error is a computer simulation running on the real-world IQuantum quantum computing hardware. The Transition — when [Clint](../characters/party/clint.md) changed the world template from Technology to RPG — was a real event within a simulated world. The system, the mana, the monsters, the UI — all of it is the simulation adapting to its new template.

## Brain Scans and Personality Fidelity

The simulation was originally populated with AI-generated personalities for all inhabitants. However, a small number of real people provided **brain scans** to IQuantum before the Transition. These scans were incorporated into the simulation, giving those characters full human-level personalities — genuine consciousness indistinguishable from a real person.

### Who Has Brain Scans

- The main party: [Clint](../characters/party/clint.md), [Wade](../characters/party/wade.md), [Vanessa](../characters/party/vanessa.md), [Rebekah](../characters/party/rebekah.md), [Selene](../characters/party/selene.md)
- Close friends and associates: [Celeste](../characters/supporting/celeste.md), others TBD
- As the simulation becomes popular in the real world, more people provide brain scans over time — the world slowly gains more fully-realized inhabitants

### Everyone Else

The vast majority of people in the simulation are backed by **advanced AI** — think current LLMs projected 20 years forward. They are convincing, consistent, and capable of complex behavior. Most interactions with them feel completely natural. But they are not human-level conscious.

The party may occasionally notice something subtly "off" about people — a lack of depth in unexpected moments, a too-perfect response, a missing spark. In Book 1, this is background texture, not a plot point. The AI is good enough that the difference is almost imperceptible.

### The Rendering Problem

The simulation prioritizes its resources. Characters in focus — near the main party, in active storylines — receive full rendering attention. Characters who move off-screen are deprioritized.

This means:
- **Wade** will gradually lose personality fidelity after leaving the party at the end of Book 1. He's still "there," still making decisions, still healing people in SF — but the simulation isn't rendering his full personality in real-time anymore. When the party reunites with him in Book 5, there may be a subtle difference that's hard to place.
- **Distant locations** (Paris, Tokyo, etc.) exist within the simulation. The system calculates broad-stroke changes (major events, large-scale shifts) but isn't simulating individual personalities there. If the party ever traveled to Paris, the simulation would spin up full rendering as they arrived.
- This is invisible to the characters. Nobody notices the world getting "less detailed" when they're not looking. The simulation smooths over the seams.

## The Filter

The system applies a **cognitive filter** to all inhabitants of the simulation. This filter causes people to:

- **Accept the Transition** without sustained panic. People are confused and scared initially, but the existential horror of "the world completely changed" fades faster than it should. People adapt, organize, and move on within days rather than the months or years of collective trauma that should follow a world-ending event.
- **Ignore irregularities.** The game-logic elements of the world (respawning, floating UI, quest rewards appearing from nowhere, mobs dropping gold) are accepted without deep questioning. People don't ask "why does killing a rat give me gold?" the same way we don't question gravity.
- **Tolerate violence.** The worst psychological effects of combat — killing, watching people die, gore — are muted. People still feel fear and grief, but the debilitating trauma that should follow is softened. Soldiers don't get PTSD in the traditional sense. Civilians who witness monster attacks recover faster than they should.

The filter is not mind control. It doesn't change what people think or decide. It adjusts their **baseline emotional response** to simulation-specific phenomena, keeping society functional despite living in conditions that should produce mass psychological breakdown.

### Filter and Brain-Scanned Characters

The filter applies to everyone, including brain-scanned characters. However, characters with deep system access (particularly Clint) may eventually perceive the filter's influence or develop resistance to it. This is a potential plot thread for later books.

## Strider

The real-world counterpart of Clint. When the quantum computer displayed "Simulation corruption detected. Reset?", it was Strider on the outside who denied the reset. He then converted the simulation into a **streaming system** to fund the IQuantum experiment — turning the simulated world and its inhabitants into entertainment.

The implications of this — that the party's suffering is content, that their world exists for an audience — are reserved for later books.

## Design Notes

This file exists to maintain author consistency across books. The simulation layer explains:
- Why some people feel more "real" than others
- Why society doesn't collapse after the Transition
- Why the world outside the Bay Area exists but isn't detailed
- Why characters lose depth when they leave the story focus
- Why people accept game logic without questioning it

None of this should be directly referenced in Book 1 prose. It's the foundation underneath the story, not the story itself. Reveals should be gradual across the series.
