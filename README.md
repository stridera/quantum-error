## Premise

Every culture ends up pondering one question as they advance far enough: Are we in a simulation? The simple answer is yes.

A group of programmers and scientists stumble upon an anomaly, granting them access to the keys of the universe. The story begins in the modern-day Bay Area and quickly transitions to a post-magic world with monsters, goblins, and dragons.
