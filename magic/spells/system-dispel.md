# System Dispel

Dispel a spell... or maybe even a person or thing at higher levels.

This attempts to delete the spell/effect/object/etc at a system level—directly removing it from the database.

## Warning

Powerful spell with the possibility to cause system stability issues depending on what is deleted.
