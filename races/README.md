# Races

## Overview

The Transition introduced racial diversity to the world. Most people remained human, but many transformed — some by choice (through the system interface), some involuntarily (like [Eron Vosk](../characters/villains/eron-vosk.md) being turned into a [Goblin](goblin.md) by [Clint](../characters/party/clint.md)).

Races tend to **cluster geographically and culturally.** Nekara and Kitsune are more common in areas with Japanese cultural influence (Japantown in SF). Elves gravitate toward forests and natural spaces. Dwarves toward mountains and underground. This isn't a hard rule — any race can be anywhere — but cultural affinity and environmental preference create natural concentrations.

## Alignment and Society

Races are not inherently good or evil. **Behavior determines alignment, not race.**

- **Good-aligned races** generally integrate into safe zone society. Elves, Dwarves, Nekara, Humans, and others coexist in cities.
- **Evil-aligned factions** are defined by their actions, not their species. Eron's goblins are hostile because Eron organized them into an army, not because goblins are inherently evil. A goblin who doesn't follow Eron could theoretically live peacefully in a safe zone.
- **Evil factions maintain their own strongholds** and are actively opposed to the good-aligned safe zones. These function as enemy territory in the overworld.

### Evil Classes and Exile

Some classes have evil applications — [Necromancers](../classes/necromancer.md), for example, can summon undead minions or summon the corpses of fallen adventurers (a legitimate service, see [Death & Respawn](../system/death.md)). These classes are not banned.

However, if a character **commits evil acts** (killing adventurers, killing civilians, betraying the safe zone), the system responds:

- The character is **exiled** from the safe zone.
- Their [bind point](../system/death.md#binding) reverts to a **hostile mob location** — an enemy stronghold or wilderness. They now respawn among monsters and enemy factions.
- This is effectively a death sentence for most, or it forces them to join an evil faction to survive. Eron's goblins likely include exiles who had nowhere else to go.

The system enforces justice through mechanics, not courts. You don't get a trial — you get relocated.

| *Others TBD* | — | — | — | — |

### Monsters

Monsters (Coyotes, Owlbears, Fog Elementals, etc.) are not races — they're system-generated creatures that populate the overworld and dungeons. They don't have classes, professions, or society. They exist as threats within the system's ecology.

## Race Selection

Race is chosen at the same time as [class selection](../system/classes-and-professions.md) — at age 16, or at the Transition for adults. Most people remain human. Choosing a non-human race is a permanent transformation.

Some races were assigned involuntarily. Eron Vosk was turned into a Goblin by Clint through direct system manipulation — this is not normal. Under standard system rules, race selection is a choice.

## Design Notes

The race system is intentionally broad. Specific races will be detailed in individual files as they become relevant to the story. The framework here establishes the rules (clustering, alignment, exile) without locking in a complete taxonomy.

The Bay Area's cultural diversity maps naturally onto racial diversity — Japantown has Nekara and Kitsune, the redwood forests have Elves, the hills have Dwarves. This keeps the world grounded in real geography while embracing fantasy.
