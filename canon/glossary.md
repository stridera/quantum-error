**Minimum Cost**
A mana rule where spells have a floor cost, but can optionally accept more mana to amplify effect (with consequences). See: `system/mana.md`.

## N

**Null Mana Zone**
An area where ambient mana is suppressed, changing spell behavior and recovery dynamics. See: `system/mana.md`.

## V
