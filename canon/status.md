# Canon Status

This page is the "what's happening right now" dashboard.

## Locked Canon
These are the most important decisions that should not drift without an explicit changelog entry.

- Canon lives in Git Markdown; the wiki is a rendered view.
- Party baseline: characters are *powerful* (power fantasy) but still constrained by system rules.
- Baseline pools: characters commonly sit at absurd caps (e.g., 999 health/mana), with exceptions (e.g., Vanessa's mana lucent effect pushing higher).

> TODO (Migration): move locked rules from chat threads into bullet points here, with links to the definitive files.

## Open Questions
Questions that must be decided before implementation or before the relevant story chapter is finalized.

- Combat math: final hit/evade curve, encumbrance impact, and "why heavy builds still hit too often" concern.
- Mana spend model: minimum cost vs variable spend, and consequences of dumping a pool into one cast.
- Temporal paradox rules: when "timeline shift" is allowed to undo a death, and what the system remembers.

> TODO (Migration): add the remaining open questions from your "modern stat system" and "spell system redesign" threads.

## In Progress
- Phase 1: System mechanics core pages (combat/effects/targeting/ui-popups/stats/mana)
- Phase 2: Party classes expanded to full 1–99 with ability stat blocks + UI popups
- Phase 3: Spirit Dungeon package — COMPLETE (overview, rooms, mobs, boss)
- Phase 4: Overworld zones — COMPLETE (aggro system, bay-area overview, 7 zone files SF→San Jose)

## Migration Backlog
See `canon/migration-backlog.md` (to be created in Phase 0/1 if desired).
