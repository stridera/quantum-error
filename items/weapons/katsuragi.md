| **Requires Attunement** | Yes |

A legendary katana constantly flickering across reality variations. The blade hums audibly and bends light when activated.

> **System Warning:** This item exists outside the [Equipment Framework](../equipment-framework.md). It was created by directly modifying reality's source code via the system console before the Transition. The system cannot classify, replicate, or constrain it. Its stats exceed the theoretical maximum for any framework-legal item.

## Origin

Originally a high-quality katana purchased by Clint for approximately $5,000 from a store pre-transition. Through Clint's [Enchanting](../../professions/enchanting.md) skill, he created magical pathways in the blade and then upgraded its stats via the system console, transforming it into a legendary weapon. The physical appearance changed dramatically during the upgrade process.

## Stats

- **Damage**: 20d20 slashing + 5d10 force
- **Attack/Damage Bonus**: +15

## Abilities

### Edge of Collapse
Once per long rest, force a Constitution save (DC 18) to phase targets partially out of reality.

### Superposition
Adapts damage type to bypass enemy resistances when wielded by its attuned user.
