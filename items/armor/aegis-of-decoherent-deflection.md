> **System Warning:** This item exists outside the [Equipment Framework](../equipment-framework.md). It was created by directly modifying reality's source code via the system console before the Transition. The system cannot classify, replicate, or constrain it. Its stats exceed the theoretical maximum for any framework-legal item.

## Origin

Originally a replica Hylian Shield purchased by Clint from a store pre-transition. Through Clint's [Enchanting](../../professions/enchanting.md) skill, he created magical pathways in the item and then upgraded its stats via the system console, transforming it into a legendary artifact. The physical appearance changed dramatically during the upgrade process.

## Stats

- **AR Bonus**: +30
- **Saving Throws**: Advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence saves
- **Resistances**: Force and elemental damage

## Abilities

### Quantum Tunnel
Once per long rest, sacrifice actions to create a 15-foot barrier that returns attacks to their source.

### Superposition Guard
Once per hour, enter quantum flux for 30 seconds with automatic spell save success and ghost-state damage immunity.

### Observer Collapse
Grants total damage immunity while unobserved. Observers must succeed a Wisdom check or still treat you as hidden.
