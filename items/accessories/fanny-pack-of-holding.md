# Fanny Pack of Holding

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Legendary Container |
| **Requires Attunement** | Yes |
| **Soulbound** | Yes |

A legendary bag of holding that appears as an unassuming fanny pack.

## Origin

Originally an ordinary fanny pack. Through Clint's [Enchanting](../../professions/enchanting.md) skill pre-transition, he created magical pathways in the item and then upgraded its stats via the system console, transforming it into a legendary artifact with extradimensional storage capacity.

## Properties

### Soulbound
This item is bound to Clint's soul and cannot be lost, stolen, or destroyed by normal means. It persists through death—when Clint respawned after the Transition, this was the only equipment he retained.

### Extradimensional Storage
Functions as a bag of holding with significant internal capacity far exceeding its external dimensions.

## Notes

- First legendary item Clint created through enchanting
- Survived Clint's first death during the Transition
- Demonstrated that soulbound items persist through the respawn mechanic
