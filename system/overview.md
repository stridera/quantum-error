# System Overview

The world operates on RPG-style mechanics after the transition.

## Classes

Classes are developmental paths defined by a character's theme. Classes are first obtained at level 15. While you can gain skills, and even more rarely spells, before this time, it's not common.

Initial class selection reflects an amalgamation of the character's past actions, feelings, and obtained skills.

See [Classes](../classes/README.md) for the full list.

## Stats

Seven core attributes govern character capabilities:

- [Strength](stats.md#strength)
- [Dexterity](stats.md#dexterity)
- [Constitution](stats.md#constitution)
- [Intelligence](stats.md#intelligence)
- [Wisdom](stats.md#wisdom)
- [Charisma](stats.md#charisma)
- [Luck](stats.md#luck)

## Magic

See [Magic Overview](../magic/overview.md) for the eight schools of magic.
