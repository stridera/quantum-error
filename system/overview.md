# System Overview

The world operates on RPG-style mechanics after the transition.

## Classes & Professions

Classes are combat/adventuring identities chosen at age 16 (or at the Transition for adults). Professions are non-combat skills and trades that operate independently from class level. A character can have one class and any number of professions.

See [Classes & Professions](classes-and-professions.md) for the full system, and [Classes](../classes/README.md) for the class list.

## Stats

Seven core attributes govern character capabilities:

- [Strength](stats.md#strength)
- [Dexterity](stats.md#dexterity)
- [Constitution](stats.md#constitution)
- [Intelligence](stats.md#intelligence)
- [Wisdom](stats.md#wisdom)
- [Charisma](stats.md#charisma)
- [Luck](stats.md#luck)
