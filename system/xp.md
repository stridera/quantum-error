# Experience & Leveling

This page defines how characters gain experience points (XP) and level up.

## Core Principle: Danger

The system rewards **risk**. XP is granted for actions where the character is in genuine danger of harm or death. The greater the danger, the greater the reward. Safe actions — no matter how skillful — grant minimal or no class XP.

This single rule governs all XP calculations and prevents most forms of exploitation.

## Class XP Sources

### Combat

The primary XP source. Killing or helping kill enemies grants XP to all participants who were **in danger during the fight.** Standing in the back behind an impenetrable shield doesn't count.

- XP scales with the enemy's level relative to the participant's level. Higher-level enemies grant more XP; grey-level enemies grant almost nothing.
- XP is shared among all participants. Larger groups split more, but fighting harder enemies compensates.
- **You must be at risk.** A L99 character cannot shield a L5 character from all harm and expect the L5 to gain full XP. The system recognizes when someone is genuinely in danger vs. being carried.

### Healing (In Danger)

Healers gain class XP for healing, but the amount depends on context:

- **Combat healing** (healing allies while under threat) grants significant XP — comparable to damage-dealing. The healer is in danger, their allies are in danger, and the healing is keeping people alive under pressure.
- **Safe-zone healing** (patching up sick kids, mending injuries in town) grants minimal class XP. The work is valuable, but there's no danger. A healer can level this way, but very slowly.

This is why [Wade](../characters/party/wade.md) reached L5 pre-Transition while the rest of the combat party reached L3 — he healed a large number of people, but much of it was low-danger healing that accumulated slowly. After leaving the party post-Book 1, Wade continues leveling in SF as the city's healer, but his progression slows significantly without combat danger.

### Class-Adjacent Actions

Some non-combat actions grant small amounts of class XP if they align with the class identity:

- **Bard ([Rebekah](../characters/party/rebekah.md)):** Performing music, soothing crowds, calming spirits. Grants minimal XP — there's no danger in a concert. XP increases if the performance has real stakes (calming a hostile crowd, soothing an angry spirit that could attack).
- **Rogue ([Selene](../characters/party/selene.md)):** Scouting, sneaking, stealing. Grants some XP when there's genuine risk of detection and harm. Pickpocketing a sleeping beggar: nothing. Scouting a goblin camp: real XP.
- **Sorceress ([Vanessa](../characters/party/vanessa.md)):** Buffing allies, creating illusions for shows. Minimal XP without danger. However, her Research profession may help her discover obscure spells or techniques that feed back into her class capabilities indirectly.
- **Paladin ([Clint](../characters/party/clint.md)):** Standard combat XP model. Clint's pre-Transition levels were hacked, not earned.

### Quests

System-recognized quests grant XP on completion. Quest XP typically reflects the danger involved — "kill the rats in my basement" grants less than "clear the goblin patrol from the highway."

## Profession XP

Profession XP is **completely separate** from class XP. Crafting, gathering, building, researching — these advance profession rank but do not contribute to class level.

- [Enchanting](../professions/enchanting.md) an item grants Enchanting profession XP. Zero class XP.
- Harvesting herbs grants Herbalism profession XP. Zero class XP.
- Forging a sword grants Blacksmithing profession XP. Zero class XP.

This is why [Celeste](../characters/supporting/celeste.md) is a Grandmaster Blacksmith but only L5 Barbarian — she's spent years at the forge, not in the field. Her profession is maxed; her class is barely started.

Classless characters can still gain profession XP normally. A classless Master Enchanter has no class level but is highly skilled at their craft.

## Anti-Exploitation

The danger requirement prevents common power-leveling exploits:

- **Shielding:** A high-level character can't make a low-level character immune to damage and feed them XP. The low-level character must be genuinely at risk.
- **Zone leeching:** Being in the same zone as your party while they fight grants nothing. You must be in the fight, taking risk.
- **Safe grinding:** Repeatedly killing enemies far below your level grants negligible XP. The system scales rewards by level delta — if it's not dangerous, it's not worth much.

## Pre-Transition XP

The system was active before the Transition completed. Actions during the pre-Transition events granted XP normally:

- The party collectively killed approximately two dozen of [Eron Vosk's](../characters/villains/eron-vosk.md) soldiers across multiple fights → L3 for combat participants.
- [Wade](../characters/party/wade.md) split off to heal sick children and others → L5 (accumulated healing XP, both from danger-adjacent situations and large volume of safe healing).
- [Clint](../characters/party/clint.md) remained L1 — his Paladin class was [locked](classes-and-professions.md#locked-classes) without a patron god, so XP couldn't apply to class leveling. His Grandmaster Enchanter rank was hacked through direct system access.
- The first [death](death.md) at IQuantum was a freebie — the system was still initializing.
