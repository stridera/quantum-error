# Quests

This page defines how quests work in the system.

## Origin

All quests are **system-generated** but delivered through **NPCs.** The system creates the quest; a person presents it.

A shopkeeper doesn't file a ticket with the system and wait for a quest to appear. Instead, the system recognizes that the shopkeeper has a rat problem and *enables* them to issue a quest for it. The shopkeeper wakes up one morning knowing they can offer a quest to clear their basement — complete with a reward the system will fund. The NPC's need is real; the system's backing makes it actionable.

This means:
- Quests feel organic. A farmer asks you to help with their crops. A guard captain asks you to patrol the perimeter. A blacksmith asks you to deliver a shipment.
- The system is invisible to the quest-giver. They don't think "the system gave me a quest to issue." They think "I need help and I can pay for it."
- Rewards ([gold](economy.md), [XP](xp.md), items, [profession XP](classes-and-professions.md)) are system-funded, not paid out of the NPC's pocket.

## Quest Types

### Combat Quests
- Clear infested locations (rats in basements, undead in buildings)
- Kill specific mobs or mob types
- Escort NPCs through dangerous areas
- Defend positions against attacks

### Profession Quests
- Craft specific items ([system buy-orders](economy.md))
- Gather materials (mining, herbalism, logging)
- Build or repair structures (fortification quests)
- Deliver goods between locations

### Civic Quests
- [Governance](governance.md) quests for leaders (organize defenses, manage resources)
- Supply chain quests (deliver food, water, medical supplies between gathering points)
- Infrastructure quests (get systems running, establish services)

### Bounties
- Standing system offers for ongoing threats
- Typically combat-oriented with scaling rewards
- Available to anyone who qualifies

### World Quests

Rare, global quests visible to **every person in the world.** These are existential — the system issues them when the simulation itself is at stake.

**The only known World Quest:**

During the Transition, [Clint](../characters/party/clint.md) changed the world template from Technology to RPG. The quantum computer at [IQuantum](../lore/organizations/iquantum.md) detected the corruption and displayed: *"System Error — Simulation corruption detected. Initial simulation boundaries exceeded. Reset?"* Mana destroyed the hardware before anyone could respond.

The system converted that unanswered prompt into a World Quest: **defeat the world boss guarding the Tablet of Annihilation within 10 years, or the simulation resets — destroying everything and everyone in it.** The quantum computer itself transformed into the Tablet, now guarded by an Ancient Red Dragon at the former IQuantum site in Saratoga (L99, [Dragon Territory](../lore/locations/bay-area.md)).

The 10-year timer is visible to everyone. The whole world knows the clock is ticking. This is the driving quest across all five books.

## Quest Visibility

Quests appear in the character's [quest log](ui.md) when accepted. Available quests are visible when interacting with the NPC who offers them. There is no global quest board broadcasting every available quest — you find quests by talking to people and exploring.

## Dynamic Generation

The system generates quests based on **actual conditions.** If rats infest a basement, a quest appears. If a trade route is threatened, an escort quest appears. If a crafter needs materials, a gathering quest appears.

This means the quest landscape shifts over time. Early post-Transition, quests are survival-focused (clear buildings, find food, establish defenses). As safe zones stabilize, quests diversify into commerce, construction, and expansion.

Quests can also **stop existing.** If someone else clears the rats, the quest is gone. If the trade route becomes safe, the escort quest disappears. The system reflects reality, not a static list.

## Anyone Can Be a Quest-Giver

The system doesn't distinguish between "NPCs" and "players" — there are no NPCs. Everyone is a real person. Anyone with a legitimate need can become a quest-giver if the system recognizes the need.

This includes the main party. As characters gain influence, professions, and responsibilities, the system enables them to issue quests just like anyone else. [Wade](../characters/party/wade.md) might issue quests for others to gather herbs or supplies he needs. [Celeste](../characters/supporting/celeste.md) issues quests for raw materials. A party member who establishes a base of operations could issue defensive or supply quests to other adventurers.

The system funds the rewards regardless of who issues the quest. The quest-giver doesn't pay out of pocket.

## Design Notes

The system-backed model keeps quests feeling natural in prose. Characters aren't interacting with a game menu — they're talking to people who need help. The system's role is invisible to most characters (though [Clint](../characters/party/clint.md) may perceive the system layer behind it).

For the novel, quests are a background mechanic. The party doesn't grind quest chains — they have a destination and a mission. Quests exist to explain how the world functions around them and why people can offer rewards for help.
