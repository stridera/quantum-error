# Classes & Professions

This page defines how classes and professions work, how they differ, and how they interact.

## Classes

A class is a character's combat and adventuring identity. It determines what abilities you unlock, how you fight, and how the system categorizes you.

### Selection

- Characters become eligible to choose a class at **age 16**.
- During the Transition, all adults (16+) were treated as if they hit this threshold instantly and were prompted to choose.
- Class selection is a **choice**. The system presents options based on an amalgamation of the character's past actions, feelings, and obtained skills — but the character decides.
- **You can decline.** People who don't choose a class remain classless. They can still work professions, gain profession skills, and live productive lives. They just don't have a combat class, don't gain class abilities, and don't level through the class system.

### Pre-Selection Training

Skills and training acquired before age 16 (or before the Transition) are not wasted. They accumulate **hidden progress** that surfaces when a class is chosen:

- A kid who trained hard with swords will start with a higher sword skill when they become a Warrior.
- A teenager who studied medicine will have a head start on healing abilities as a Cleric.
- This hidden progress only manifests once a class is selected — it doesn't grant abilities on its own.

### Leveling

Class level is gained through experience (XP). XP comes from combat, quests, and other system-recognized achievements. Class level is what the system uses for [aggro detection](aggro.md), Inspect results, and power scaling.

Classless characters do not have a class level. They exist outside the leveling system — the system still tracks them, but they don't progress the way classed characters do.

### One Class

You get one class. It can't be changed. Choose carefully.

### Locked Classes

Some classes have **conditions** that must be met for the class to function. [Clint's](../characters/party/clint.md) Paladin of the System is an example: the Paladin class channels holy power, which requires a patron god. Without one, the class is inert — basic abilities may exist, but the class can't level and its full power is inaccessible. The system treated Clint as effectively classless until his patron condition was resolved.

## Professions

Professions represent non-combat skills, crafts, and trades. They are the backbone of civilization in the post-Transition world.

### How They Work

- **No limit on professions.** A character can learn and practice any number of professions.
- **No primary/secondary restriction.** There is no system-enforced hierarchy. The only limiting factors are **time** and **gear** — you can theoretically master everything, but nobody has enough hours.
- **Natural specialization:** In practice, people specialize because advancing a profession takes focused effort. A character who splits time between Blacksmithing and Enchanting will advance both more slowly than someone who focuses on one. Gear further encourages specialization — a master blacksmith's tools don't help with alchemy.
- **Independent from class level.** Profession rank is entirely separate from class level. A L5 Barbarian can be a Grandmaster Blacksmith. A classless person can be a Master Enchanter. The two systems don't interact mechanically.

### Profession Abilities

Professions grant their own abilities, but only **within the context of that profession's work.** A Grandmaster Blacksmith gets power strikes at the anvil, heat manipulation for metalworking, and material-sensing abilities — but these don't translate to combat unless the profession skill specifically applies (e.g., a blacksmith might evaluate the quality of an enemy's armor, but their forge hammer isn't empowered in a fight).

This means profession rank reflects genuine mastery of the craft, not just repetitive grinding. A grandmaster's work is qualitatively different from an apprentice's — the system recognizes and empowers true skill.

### Skill Translation (Post-Transition)

The system recognized pre-Transition competence. People who already had real-world skills received corresponding profession ranks immediately:

- A senior software developer became a Master [Enchanter](../professions/enchanting.md).
- An experienced welder became a Journeyman Blacksmith.
- A structural engineer became an Expert in fortification magic.

See [Lore Overview — Profession Translation](../lore/overview.md#profession-translation) for details.

### Profession Rank

Professions use a **1-99 skill level** with named rank tiers at breakpoints, mirroring the 1-99 class level range.

| Skill Level | Rank | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| 1-9 | Novice | Learning the basics. Can perform simple tasks with guidance. |
| 10-24 | Apprentice | Competent at fundamental tasks. Working under or alongside experienced practitioners. |
| 25-49 | Journeyman | Independent professional. Solid, reliable work. Can take on most standard jobs. |
| 50-74 | Expert | Highly skilled. Recognized quality. Can handle complex or unusual work. |
| 75-89 | Master | Top of the field. Creates exceptional work. Can teach others effectively. |
| 90-98 | Grandmaster | Extraordinary. Creates remarkable work that pushes the boundaries of the craft. Very few reach this tier. |
| 99 | **System-Granted Title** | See below. |

### The 99th Rank: System-Granted Title

When a practitioner reaches skill level 99 in a profession, the system grants them a **unique title** specific to their craft and identity. This is not a generic rank — it's a personal name bestowed by the system, recognizing the character as the single greatest living practitioner of that profession.

**Only one person per profession can hold the 99th rank at any time.**

If another practitioner reaches the threshold, they must defeat the current title holder in a **profession challenge** — a system-adjudicated contest of craft. The nature of the challenge depends on the profession (a forge-off for blacksmiths, an enchantment duel for enchanters, etc.). If the challenger wins, they receive the title and the former holder drops to 98.

The title is narrative — the system names you something meaningful. Not "Grandmaster Blacksmith" but something personal, like a name the system chooses based on who you are and what you've created.

[Clint](../characters/party/clint.md) hacked his way to Grandmaster Enchanter — whether he technically holds a system-granted title or bypassed the system's recognition is an open question.

## Party Professions

| Character | Profession(s) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| [Clint](../characters/party/clint.md) | Enchanting (Grandmaster — hacked) | Has the rank without doing the work. Skill to create legendary enchantments, if he can find the materials. |
| [Selene](../characters/party/selene.md) | Poison crafting (specifics TBD) | Focused on creating poisons. May fall under Alchemy or be its own specialization. |
| [Rebekah](../characters/party/rebekah.md) | Herbalism | The flower girl. Gathers herbs and plants, supplies ingredients. The bard who loves music and flowers. |
| [Wade](../characters/party/wade.md) | Cooking | Feeds the party. Specifics TBD. |
| [Vanessa](../characters/party/vanessa.md) | Research | Scientist background maps to investigation and knowledge work. Specifics TBD. |

## Notable Professionals

| Character | Class | Profession | Notes |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------|
| [Celeste](../characters/supporting/celeste.md) | Barbarian (L5) | Blacksmithing (Grandmaster) | Chose Barbarian for the strength buffs but never leaves town. Her craft is her life. Partners with her enchanter husband. |

## Design Notes

The class/profession split serves two purposes:

1. **World-building:** It explains how safe zones function. Most people don't adventure — they craft, build, farm, and trade. The economy runs on professions, not combat classes. Adventurers are a minority.
2. **Party dynamics:** Each party member has a non-combat identity that contributes to the group. Selene makes poisons, Rebekah gathers herbs, Wade cooks, Vanessa researches, Clint enchants. These professions create downtime scenes, party interactions, and practical problem-solving that complement the combat narrative.
