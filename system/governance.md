# Governance

This page defines how safe zones are governed after the Transition.

## Leadership Profession

Existing leaders kept their roles. The mayor stayed the mayor. City council members stayed on the council. The system recognized their pre-Transition authority and granted them a **Leader profession** with abilities and quests designed to guide effective governance.

### How It Works

- Leaders receive **system-generated quests** that direct civic priorities: fund the town guard, establish food rationing, organize building fortification, assign patrol routes.
- Quest rewards include gold and profession XP, same as any other profession.
- The quests guide leaders toward **good decisions** — the system nudges governance in productive directions. A mayor who follows the quest chain ends up with a well-organized, well-defended city.
- **No corruption.** The system's quest structure and transparency make graft effectively impossible. You can't embezzle system gold. You can't misdirect system quests. The Leader profession rewards competent governance and offers no mechanism for self-enrichment at the public's expense.

### Practical Effect

In Book 1, safe zone governance is functional but strained. Leaders are doing their best with system guidance, but the Transition was catastrophic and the problems are enormous — food supply, shelter, defense, morale, the constant threat from outside the safe zone. The system helps, but it doesn't solve everything.

The mayor of San Francisco is still the mayor. They have quests telling them what to prioritize. They have profession abilities that help them organize and lead. But they're still a person trying to hold a city together after the world ended.

## Town Guard

One of the first governance quests is establishing a **town guard** — armed residents who patrol the safe zone and handle internal threats (clearing instanced dungeon content like basement rats, maintaining order, defending the perimeter). Guards are typically low-level classed characters who chose combat classes but prefer the safety of organized defense over adventuring.

## Communication Between Safe Zones

### Book 1

**No long-range communication exists.** Safe zones are isolated. San Francisco doesn't know the status of Oakland, San Jose, or any other city. Information travels only as fast as a person can walk through dangerous territory.

This means:
- The party heading south is heading into the unknown.
- No one in SF knows what's happening in the goblin-controlled south.
- Safe zones may not even know other safe zones survived.

### Later Books

Teleportation magic and communication spells eventually connect safe zones, enabling trade, coordination, and movement between cities. The details are TBD for future books.
