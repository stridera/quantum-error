Wade Henning is Clint's boss at iQuantum. A large man with a "dad-bod," sandy blond hair, and green eyes. He has drawings from his kids on his DM screen during D&D sessions.

## Family

- Wife: [Amanda](../supporting/amanda.md)
- Daughters: [The Twins](../supporting/the-twins.md)

Wade's motivation throughout Book I is protecting his family. His daughter's terminal illness drove the party to experiment with the system, and the capture of his wife and children by Eron Vosk drives much of the plot.

## Post-Book I

After Eron's defeat and his family's reunion, Wade decides to step away from active adventuring. He has flashbacks of the "real world" and knows his daughters should have died. He refuses to be apart from them again.
