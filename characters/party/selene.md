## Pre-Transition: Dustin

Before the transition, Selene was Dustin—a closeted trans woman who worked as iQuantum's Chief Legal Officer. Dustin stood just over 5 feet tall with stringy blond hair and blue eyes, and was described as "enthusiastically chipper."

The transition transformed her into a Nekara catgirl rogue, finally allowing her to live as her true self.
