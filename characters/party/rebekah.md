Rebekah Sullivan is a recruiter who joins the group at the beginning due to mutual friendships. Once the conversion happens, she becomes a Temporal Bard.

Rebekah acts as a source of inspiration and hope when things start to look dark. Her magic will keep them moving forward and give significant buffs to the team.

Rebekah, a woman of 26, stands at 5'8" with an arresting presence accentuated by her fiery red hair cascading down her shoulders. Freckles adorn her fair skin, adding a touch of whimsy to her appearance. Her Scottish heritage is evident in the lilt of her voice, echoing the rolling hills of her ancestral home.
