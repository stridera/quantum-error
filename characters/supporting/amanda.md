# Amanda

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Supporting Character |
| **Relationship** | Wade's wife, mother of the twins |
| **Class** | TBD |

Amanda is Wade's wife and the mother of their twin daughters. She becomes a major figure in the Book I plot when Eron Vosk captures and mind-controls her.

## Pre-Transition

Amanda was at the hospital with her daughters when one of them went into cardiac arrest. The party saved both twins by converting them to the RPG template and healing them via the system console.

## Capture

When Eron's forces captured Wade, they also took Amanda and the twins as leverage. While the party was able to rescue Wade, Amanda and the children remained captive.

## Mind Control

Eron Vosk, as a [Mind Mage](../../classes/mind-mage.md), placed Amanda under active mind control. This makes her a threat to the party:
- She unknowingly raises alarms when the party attempts rescue
- Families can sense each other's locations — Eron uses her to track the party
- She cannot accept healing while under mind control

## Liberation

The party discovers that the Null Magic Zone can break Eron's mind control. Once freed, Amanda joins the party temporarily, gaining protection from [Clint's](../party/clint.md) aura against further mental manipulation.

## Post-Book I

After Eron's defeat and the family's reunion, Wade decides to step away from active adventuring to be with Amanda and their daughters.

## Relationships

- Wife of [Wade](../party/wade.md)
- Mother of [the twins](the-twins.md)
- Former captive of [Eron Vosk](../villains/eron-vosk.md)
