# The Twins

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Supporting Characters |
| **Relation** | Daughters of Wade |
| **Age** | 12 |

The identical twin daughters of [Wade](../party/wade.md) and [Amanda](amanda.md). They were healed by Clint before the Transition, which granted them extraordinary attributes.

## Stats

- Health: 99
- Luck: 20 (set by Clint when healing them—this absurdly high luck triggers both good and bad fortune)

## Post-Transition

When Eron Vosk captured Wade's family, the twins' supernatural luck led to an unexpected outcome: they were taken in by wolves. Due to their Luck 20, what should have been a dangerous situation became an opportunity.

The twins are developing **druid/hunter** abilities through their bond with the wolves. They are too young to have official classes, but the system allows skills and abilities to develop in the background. Clint can see this progression with his System Identify.

They eventually ride the wolves into battle during the rescue of their mother.

## Abilities

### Perfect Telepathy

Innate Skill. Allows perfect communication, including all senses, between the two twins. At higher levels, it may allow the sharing of skills and abilities.

The twins always know each other's location and feelings.

## Relationships

- Daughters of [Wade](../party/wade.md) and [Amanda](amanda.md)
- Wolf companions (names TBD)
