Owner of Clayandsteel, a blacksmith shop. Post-Transition, Celeste gained magic tied to her craft — the ability to keep metal hot and workable, manipulate heat, and shape materials with magical precision. Her husband is a programmer who became an [Enchanter](../../professions/enchanting.md), and together they forge and enchant weapons. She makes the steel; he inscribes the magic.
