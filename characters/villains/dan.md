# Dan

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Villain |
| **Pre-Transition Job** | VP of Engineering at iQuantum |
| **Class** | Necromancer |
| **Race** | Troll |

Dan was the VP of Engineering at iQuantum and the official team leader before the Transition. He became one of the primary antagonists after betraying the party.

## Pre-Transition

Dan was present at the initial D&D session when Clint discovered the anomaly. After the team confirmed they existed within a simulation with editable parameters, Dan was deeply disturbed by the implications.

**Key Events**:
- Left immediately after the discovery was confirmed, unable to cope
- Contacted Eron Vosk and disclosed everything despite NDA
- Returned to demand access, claiming they could become "rich and powerful"
- Dustin (Selene) threatened legal action for NDA breach
- Aligned fully with Eron Vosk's faction

## Confrontation

Dan was present when Wade was captured and tortured at Eron's compound. He made clear his allegiance was to Eron's vision of using the system for wealth and control.

During the final confrontation at iQuantum HQ:
- Sided with Eron Vosk against his former colleagues
- Present when Vanessa was killed by sniper fire
- Witnessed the Transition firsthand

## Post-Transition

Dan's race and class were not manually selected by the party. His current form as a Necromancer Troll reflects either:
- Default system assignment based on his nature/actions
- Selection by Eron Vosk's faction
- His own choice after gaining system access

## Relationships

- Former colleague of the main party
- Allied with [Eron Vosk](eron-vosk.md)
- Particularly hostile toward Clint (who discovered the anomaly Dan couldn't accept)
