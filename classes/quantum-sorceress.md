# Quantum Sorceress

Using magic to control the world.

Sorceresses channel raw magical power through force of will. The Quantum Sorceress variant draws on principles of quantum mechanics—probability, superposition, and observation effects.

## Design Philosophy

- **Role**: Ranged DPS, area damage, battlefield control
- **Theme**: Emotional amplification, instability as power
- **Unique Mechanic**: Spells tagged as **Anchor** (stable), **Amplified** (scales with emotion), or **Breaking** (reality-altering)

## Instability System

| Tag | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| **Anchor** | Stable, predictable, emotionally neutral |
| **Amplified** | Emotional load increases power but reduces control |
| **Breaking** | Reality-bending effects with environmental aftermath |

## Ability Progression (Levels 1-20)

| Level | Ability | Type | Tags | Effect |
|-------|---------|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Mana Sense | Passive | perception | Perceive ambient mana density, spell residue, and nearby casting pressure |
| 1 | Arcane Bolt | Spell | anchor | Launch a focused arcane projectile; reliable baseline damage |
| 2 | Spell Focus | Passive | control | Increased spell precision and reduced cast disruption |
| 3 | Mana Shield | Spell | anchor | Convert mana into a protective barrier |
| 3 | Minor Illusion | Spell | anchor | Create a small visual or auditory illusion |
| 4 | Elemental Affinity | Passive | amplified | Emotions bias how magic expresses (fear→cold, rage→fire, focus→lightning) |
| 5 | Fireball | Spell | amplified | Explodes on impact, damaging enemies in an area |
| 6 | Channel Mana | Utility | anchor | Recover mana more efficiently when not actively casting |
| 7 | Frost Bind | Spell | anchor | Deal cold damage and apply slow or brief root |
| 7 | Veil Image | Spell | amplified | Project moving illusory doubles that confuse targeting |
| 10 | Lightning Lance | Spell | amplified | Piercing bolt that excels against armored targets |
| 10 | Displacement | Spell | amplified | Persistent misalignment between where you are and appear |
| 11 | Mana Surge | Utility | amplified | Immediate mana gain; increases escalation risk |
| 12 | Spell Weaving | Passive | anchor | Chaining spells reduces cast time and improves flow |
| 13 | Flame Wave | Spell | amplified | Sweeping cone of flame hitting multiple enemies |
| 14 | Arcane Ward | Spell | anchor | Reactive ward that reduces incoming magical harm |
| 14 | Mirror Phantasm | Spell | amplified | Multiple illusionary selves fracturing enemy targeting |
| 15 | Elemental Mastery I | Passive | amplified | Elemental spells gain secondary effects based on emotional state |
| 16 | Void Pulse | Spell | breaking | Disruptive pulse that destabilizes casting and compresses space |
| 17 | Mana Burn | Spell | breaking | Tears at mana; drains reserves and harms through power |
| 18 | Arcane Instinct | Passive | anchor | When critically threatened, magic reacts first (ward flare, reflexive displacement) |
| 19 | Spell Cascade | Passive | amplified | Area spells expand or chain when emotional load is high |
| 20 | **Cataclysm** | Capstone | breaking | Reality-bending devastation; this is an event, not just damage |

## Mana Lucent

A concept specific to Vanessa: after her Mana Shock, her eyes and veins glow softly with mana. The glow shifts toward the elemental color of whatever spell she is casting.
