# Veilstepper Rogue

Sneaky sneaky.

Rogues specialize in stealth, precision strikes, and exploiting enemy weaknesses. The Veilstepper variant focuses on moving between shadows and dimensions—**phase**, not illusion.

## Design Philosophy

- **Role**: Single-target burst DPS, assassination, isolation
- **Theme**: Phase manipulation, existing between states
- **Unique Mechanic**: Veil—not invisibility, but existing loosely in the present layer

## Core Distinction

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stealth** | Conventional hiding; broken by observation |
| **Veil** | Phase state; you are not fully here |
| **Illusion** | False images (Sorceress domain) |
| **Phase** | Existing across adjacent reality layers |

## Ability Progression (Levels 1-20)

| Level | Ability | Type | Effect |
|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 1 | Sneak | Toggle | Enter stealth when unobserved; quieter movement |
| 1 | Backstab | Attack | Increased damage from behind or while Veiled |
| 2 | Nekara Agility | Racial Passive | Increased evasion, balance, and movement speed |
| 3 | Veil Sense | Passive | Detect veiled, phased, or partially absent entities |
| 4 | Shadowstep | Utility | Short-range reposition between nearby shadows |
| 5 | Bleeding Strike | Attack | Apply bleeding wound (damage over time) |
| 6 | Sidestep Between Selves | Passive | Flicker between possible states, causing attacks to miss |
| 7 | Smoke Veil | Utility | Create visual disruption that breaks observation and allows Veil re-entry |
| 8 | Chosen Shadow | Passive | Gain bonuses while unobserved or Veiled |
| 9 | Weak Point Analysis | Passive | Crit chance increases with undetected observation time |
| 10 | Shadow Ambush | Attack | Reposition and strike simultaneously; powerful opener |
| 11 | Evasion Roll | Reaction | Avoid a lethal hit once per cooldown |
| 12 | Phase Cut | Attack | Strike along phase alignment, bypassing armor |
| 13 | Veil Mastery I | Passive | Veil lasts longer and is harder to detect |
| 14 | Silence | Utility | Prevent spellcasting and vocal abilities in small area |
| 15 | Double Image | Defensive | Leave brief afterimage when attacking or repositioning |
| 16 | Umbral Dance | Buff | Increased movement speed and crit chance |
| 17 | Shadow Reversal | Reaction | Swap position with attacker at moment of impact |
| 18 | Ghost Strike | Attack | Damages targets in present layer and adjacent phase layers |
| 19 | Perfect Predator | Passive | Massive bonuses when attacking isolated targets |
| 20 | **Veil Ascension** | Capstone | Near-total control over phase state; only loosely anchored to present |

## Key Mechanics

### Veil State
- Not invisibility—phase displacement
- Broken by direct observation or interaction
- Enhanced by isolation and shadows

### Phase Attacks
- Phase Cut ignores armor
- Ghost Strike hits across phase layers
- Effective against unstable or phased entities
