# Temporal Bard

Charisma-based magic users who cast using their voices and instruments. This subclass specializes in temporal manipulation through song.

## Design Philosophy

- **Role**: Support, buffs/debuffs, action economy manipulation
- **Theme**: Time effects alter order, timing, and outcomes—not direct damage
- **Unique Mechanic**: Song stacking—multiple songs active concurrently up to song limit

## Core Rules

- All songs affect listeners within audible range
- Songs can stack; they do not replace each other
- Duration: sustained while singing plus fade time
- Time effects manipulate order and timing, never deal direct damage

## Ability Progression (Levels 1-20)

| Level | Ability | Type | Effect |
|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 1 | [Chrono Resonance](../magic/spells/chrono-resonance.md) | Passive | Songs interact with temporal threads; songs function without instrument if needed |
| 1 | Tempo Boost | Song | Allies act and move faster |
| 2 | Rewind Note | Utility | Slightly rolls back a recent cooldown or timing mistake |
| 3 | Dissonant Chord | Song | Enemies fall out of sync—minor slow and confusion |
| 3 | Veil of Offbeats | Song | Allies blur across adjacent timelines, increasing evasion |
| 4 | Harmonic Memory | Passive | Maintain multiple learned songs concurrently |
| 5 | Accelerando | Song | Increases ally attack and casting speed |
| 6 | Time Slip | Utility | Minor self rewind—adjusts position or state from moments ago |
| 7 | Echo Verse | Song | Periodically re-pulses the last song's effect |
| 8 | Temporal Awareness | Passive | Sense out-of-sync entities, altered timelines, and temporal interference |
| 9 | Lullaby of Pauses | Song | Enemies experience brief temporal stalls (hesitation, skipped beats) |
| 10 | Chrono Shield | Song | Incoming damage is delayed and softened as time absorbs the impact |
| 11 | Polyphonic Casting | Passive | Increases maximum concurrent songs |
| 12 | Stolen Moment | Utility | Chance to gain an extra action by borrowing from an adjacent beat |
| 13 | Dirge of Delay | Song | Enemy action economy slows (longer windups, delayed responses) |
| 14 | Refrain of Continuity | Song | Extends duration of active buffs and beneficial effects |
| 15 | Temporal Mastery I | Passive | Songs affect wider area and maintain coherence at greater distance |
| 16 | Time Ripple | Song | Songs can affect enemies not yet present in the immediate moment |
| 17 | Finale: Split Second | Song | Party acts before enemies at start of engagement |
| 18 | Perfect Pitch | Passive | Songs no longer require an instrument |
| 19 | Grand Cadence | Song | Powerful multi-buff crescendo affecting allies across timing dimensions |
| 20 | **Time Unbound** | Capstone | Ignore certain time-based restrictions (cooldowns, delays, sequence penalties) |

## Song Limit

The number of concurrent songs is limited and increases with:
- Harmonic Memory (Level 4)
- Polyphonic Casting (Level 11)

## Design Notes

Inspired by D&D Homebrew College of Time subclass.
