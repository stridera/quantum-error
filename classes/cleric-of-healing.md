# Cleric of Healing

Healers that channel divine power to heal and combat the undead.

A traditional cleric focused on restoration and support. Unlike the Paladin of the System, the Cleric of Healing has no special system ties—purely divine magic channeled through faith.

## Design Philosophy

- **Role**: Primary healer, party sustain, anti-undead
- **Theme**: Steady, reliable, with subtle trauma cues
- **Unique Mechanic**: Emotional limiter—spells always work, but exact a personal cost

## Emotional Limiter

Wade's class includes an emotional limiter mechanic:
- Healing spells **always function as intended**
- Strong emotions may surface after casting
- Trauma cues are informational; they do not alter spell reliability
- The cost is psychological, not mechanical
